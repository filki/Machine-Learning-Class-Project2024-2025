From a distance she seems ravishing, you can't wait until you have her in your arms. And five minutes later you feel empty, disgusted with yourself. You feel tricked.

At the start, it seems like the game ought to be a huge improvement over its predecessor. There are more options for character creation. There is a greater focus on your party members. The combat promises a wide variety of approaches to encounters, limited only by your imagination. But after a while, you'll start to realize that the freedom the game offers is an illusion.

Perhaps the biggest bone of contention is the armour system. Instead of reducing damage or making your enemies harder to hit, it instead acts an additional set of hitpoints, divided into magic armour and physical armour. This armour must be depleted before you can start doing damage to an enemy or start applying status effects against your enemy, and since the armour is divided into two categories the game strongly encourages the player to go with all-physical or all-magical parties. On my first play-through I foolishly went with one spellcasting character in my party, which meant that were basically doing bugger all to the enemy while the rest of the team were the ones doing damage.

Surfaces make a return from the first game, and while they aren't a bad idea in practice they become so obstrusive as the game goes on that at times it feels you're spending more time putting out fires than fighting the enemy. And this game even introduces ""cursed"" surfaces that are even harder to get rid of!

The game's encounter design is awful, packed to the gunwales with ""Gotcha!"" encounters that start out with the player suddenly being thrown into combat where the enemy will invariably go first (regardless of how many points you put into Wits) and then proceed to insta-gib one of your party members. So you reload and try a different strategy, many of which are completely absurd. For example, in one encounter, my party faced off against a witch, who opened combat by INSTANTLY nuking my party. The solution? Have one character engage her in dialogue, and have another teleport her over to another powerful NPC, who can deal with her handily. When you ""break"" an encounter like this, you'll probably feel clever the first time you do it, like you've outsmarted the developers. But then you realize that those developers deliberately designed the game like this, and suddenly it feels cheap.

And then there's the writing...oh dear. I'm convinced that whoever wrote Divinity: Original Sin 2 was either a sociopath or someone whose entire socialization occured on an unmoderated internet forum.

The first Original Sin was quite silly, and at times it felt like it was trying to summon the spirit of Terry Pratchett. The humour didn't always work, and the jokes didn't always land, but I found it to be a welcome change from the obscenely po-faced and self-serious Pillars of Eternity. But with Original Sin 2, the writer seems to have caught the disease that a lot of writers succumb to, which is the feeling that they aren't being taken seriously. So they decided to fill the story with the same tired grimdark cliches that have been plaguing fantasy settings for over a decade now. Fantasy racism! Religious fanaticism! Oppressed mages! At the same time, however, they also retained some of the absurd humour of the first Original Sin, resulting a game that's just...tonally confused. One moment you'll be treated to the horrific sight of people being magically lobotomized, and the next you're speaking with a talking squirrel reading on an undead cat. Just what the hell am I supposed to FEEL when presented when presented with this sort of thing?

Well, one thing's for certain, which is that the writing in Original Sin 2 makes me feel bored, irritated, and bewildered.

Nearly every NPC is some variation of vile, loathsome, irritating, contemptible, or monstrous. Every faction is corrupt and debased. Talking to people more often than not results in a barrage of insults, condescension, and mockery, for no other than reason than you dared to engage them in conversation. I could count maybe two or three individuals who weren't irredeemable knobheads, and those that weren't usually had nothing to offer except some sob story. Did you think that talking to animals might provide some much-needed levity? Well, you'd be wrong, because they're all sob stories, too! And your party members? Well, with the possible exception of the dwarf and the bard, they're also a bunch jerks and edgelords.

By the end of game, I wanted to side with the bad guys, just so I could finally destroy this miserable, hateful world.

I know I'm harping on the game's joyless tone a lot, and that's because it's so INESCAPABLE. You can't play Original Sin 2 without it burrowing into your brain like some kind of malignant tumour. Really, I fail to see the appeal in playing a game that feels like being confronted by a bully in a high school locker room, or working at a customer service job in a world populated exclusively by the worst sort of Karens. It's a tabletop game run by a DM with nothing but utter hatred and scorn for the players. What's fun about that?

I've had to force myself to play this far and I just can't do it anymore. I have absolutely no idea why this game is so highly rated. The combat CAN be good, but most of the time it's an absolute slog. The game loves to throw an insane amount of enemies at you to really slow things down. I'll give you an example: 

There's a fight in the second act of the game at an oil drill where you have to fight a handful of magisters. The fight triggers once you get to the top of the oil platform, and if you hit the dialog checks, you can have one extra guy in the fight. So you're fighting the magisters, no biggie. Then halfway through the fight, an absolute TON of oil blob monsters spawn all over the ground, completely surrounding the platform. But that's fine, you have the high ground right? Wrong. These things can jump clear across the map and land on the platform right next to you. Okay, so deal with the ones on the platform, then launch fireballs at the ones on the ground. They're made of oil, they should explode. And they do. Problem is, that sets the ENTIRE ground on fire because everything is covered in oil. And the blobs that don't die from the initial explosion...well, they turn into fire blobs, so you've just created the most deadly situation possible. So you reload and go back to the platform, start the fight over again. This time you make sure not to use any fire attacks (making your fire mage absolutely useless) so the oil blobs won't turn into fire blobs. Well guess what? There are oil barrels on the ground and at some point during the fight, they will just explode. You didn't shoot them. If a blob attacked one of the barrels, it still shouldn't have exploded, because the blobs don't deal fire damage. The barrels just randomly explode. So now you have to deal with fire blobs whether you like it or not, and 90% of the battlefield is covered in fire. But that's okay, your other mage has a rain spell that should put out the fire, right? Nope. This is CURSED fire, so water doesn't put it out. The only way to deal with cursed surfaces is to cast Bless on them, which uses Source...a very limited resource you need for your strongest combat abilities. It's a very long, tedious battle that drags on forever. Most fights play out like this, with an overwhelming number of enemies and deadly surfaces. 

So what about the story, is it any better? No. Every faction in this world is some form of bad guy and the world is being invaded by monsters. Your only goal is to ascend to godhood and deal with the problem yourself. Oh but guess what, all your companions want to ascend to godhood too. And at a certain part in the story, if you don't have a high enough persuasion skill or a good relationship with them, they'll just straight up leave your party. They're all incredibly one-dimensional and boring, so losing them wouldn't be that big of a deal...except you've invested 30+ hours into them and they're an integral part of your team. I had to reload a save and respec my main character into higher persuasion, just so I could convince the lizard prince to stay with me. Even though I'd done his main sidequest, he didn't like me enough to stay on his own, and I wasn't about to lose my tank. Of course, ultimately it didn't matter, because I just can't take any more of this game. The story is boring, the characters are boring, the world is boring, and the fights are incredibly tedious. 

If you want to play a game where every faction is villainous but done well, go play Tyranny. If you want to play a game where the world is being invaded and you have to stop it, go play Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.

This game makes about all of the errors of a game like Underrail, but made by a much larger and more equipped studio. It's fairly easy to find many good write ups of the games strong points, so here I will note some of its weaknesses. 

1) By far, the games biggest shortcoming is the way it handles level-gating of it's content combined with the drought of XP. Basically, you have to explore the wide open game areas in a very strict order or you will run into enemies that are virtually impossible at your current level. This frequently turns into save-scumming for hours, trying to find the next level-appropriate encounter. Exploration is PUNISHED with death. While games based on D&D generally scale linearly, this game scales exponentially, making a difference of 1 level almost impossible to overcome. This wouldn't be THAT big of a deal if it weren't for the fact that a good portion of the XP is easily miss-able, making it way too easy to become under-leveled. You can't skip ANYTHING or you will fall behind on XP. It seems they made this problem worse in the definitive edition, nerfing some of the games most generous XP rewards and making it even harder to stay on track. It cannot be overstated how much this brings the game down. 

2) The gear grind is another thing, related to the issue above. In addition to character power levels scaling wildly, their equipment does as well. What this means is that every time you level up, you need to take a break from exploring to update the weakest gear of your party. Cool, you gotta take a mandatory shopping trip every level, that sucks a lot but OK. What is worse is how this system completely devalues unique equipment. That cool unique level 12 sword you had to complete a quest for is just about always worse than a boring common level 14 sword. In addition, if you defy all odds and somehow manage to get access to a weapon above your level, seemingly miles ahead of your current gear, it is useless; your character receives a massive accuracy penalty for even holding it. This also comes with the opposite problem; if you go back to finish a quest you are well past the level of (which you pretty much have to for XP), you will be rewarded with useless gear. Further, if you level up mid-dungeon, and the game expects you to be, say, level 13 at the beginning, and level 14 by the end, prepare for that level 14 fight to suck. You're level 14, you're armor and weapons should be level 14, right? Nope, not unless you haul it back to town for your mandatory shopping trip. 

3) My third gripe with the game is it's crafting system. I think crafting systems don't belong in most games they get put into, this game included, though I think this is a weaker criticism than those above. My issue with these systems comes from the observation that they all seem to turn into boring busywork to pad out the game time. For example, why does every craft need a progress bar? To waste your time. I have no idea what items I should be grabbing because some recipes require jars, teddy bears, sticks, paper, and all of the other random junk you come across. Do I just pick up everything? If I do, the game turns into an inventory management nightmare. Does anyone actually find this fun? I would rather be exploring, solving puzzles, or fighting void-woken than this. For god's sake, just let my character pay someone to do this crap for me!!

4) Perhaps the most frustrating issue is the botched mouse control. What you mouse over is not what you click on. You will frequently unintentionally walk over and loot stuff during combat because the game decided that you clicked on a corpse rather than the enemy. Sometimes, you have to mouse into the middle of the air in order to select something. This is the biggest BS sometimes and makes me want to swear and uninstall. So many unnecessary reloads from this crap.

5) My final criticism is that the character building and combat system, and how they intertwine, is utter trash. The gist is that, due to the new armor system, you MUST maximize damage over everything. The character building system seems robust until you realize that almost all options simply don't maximize damage and thus are non-viable. All good builds are essentially the exact same thing; maximize your damage attribute/ability and splash poly, scoundrel, etc for OP abilities, simple as that. The game is also quite difficult and really expects up-to-par characters, so good luck making it work without hours of research. 

Final Thoughts
The more time I spend playing this game, the less I like it. If you can get past all of the sloppy mechanics, build a team of bad MFs to take on this games challenges, it can be pretty good fun, for a bit. However, most of the time spent playing this game seems to be A) grabbing heaps of ""crap you might need later"", B) reloading because you got OHKOd by an enemy 1 level above you, C) reloading again because you mis-clicked and wasted your turn in combat, or D) slowly prodding the game world for the next level appropriate chunk of content.",1712419652,1712545119,False,17,2,0.5997095108032225,1,True,False,False,False,435150,20250114_132026,negative,100

The way the dialogue is written for your character is unlike many other RPGs I've played, written in 2nd person in such a way that you only get the broad strokes of what your character is saying.

Playing an Origin character, the Red Prince, had mixed results for me. I picked him because the general consensus is custom characters feel a bit lacking in comparison. But it was plainly obvious I was playing him far nicer than the writers intended him to be, because every one of his unique dialogue options ran contrary to how I intended to play him. I think this level of choice could actually be a detriment, i'd rather Larian have done something closer to Deus Ex where the Origin characters at least had more spoken dialogue and didn't give you 4 dialogue options every time for a response, where most of those result in the sameish reply from the NPCs. It's just fluff at that point. BG3 has this issue too but to a lesser extent.

The gameplay was... too messy. Larian struggles to make a UI that doesn't feel user-hostile and messy as hell to use. BG3 after this managed to get to what I consider passable - DOS2's is just not enjoyable to interact with and requires constant micromanaging to keep usable, and that's time spent away from interacting with the core gameplay and the story. DOS2's turn-based combat feels slow and clunky compared to similar games, and the surface system would have benefitted immensely from using a grid. Animations are slow and lack weight, prepare to hear ""I'll yield to none!"" quite a bit, and be forced to often choose between moving and attacking since they draw from the same resource of action points. 

The leveling system is a bit too freeform for my tastes. There's no classes per se, simply tons of skills you can choose form an level up in, but to me it is nice to have the structure of a class but the option to branch into others via multiclassing or the like. This felt like utter choice paralysis for me as the game doesn't do a particularly great job easing you into its mechanics either. At some point it started feeling like I needed to pull up the wiki and build guides just to operate at a base level.

Gear progression is tied to the merchant's randomized inventories and did NOT feel like it kept up with enemy levels unless you were grinding out every single quest in an area, which didn't feel good. By the time I reached the end of Act 1, the challenge felt reasonable for the Act boss, but as soon as Act 2 began I felt miles behind the level curve once again and put down the game because I wasn't down to spend more than 28 hours in Act 1 again. 

It's a shame though because I was enjoying the story, as grim and dark as it was from the outset. The art style is nice, though the presentation is extremely basic when it comes to dialogue unfortunately. I was interested in the world Larian had crafted and the Lizards, as lazily named as they are, were my favorite race playing as the Red Prince. 

I gave it a good shot but this game isn't for me, it just never clicked, but there's something good here that you might be able to enjoy better than me depending on your tastes.

The way some things are structured you quite easily lose a few hours.

Random dialogue options/ characters = INSTA-DEATH (like i have to explore everything to gain enough XP. to add random insta death characters all over the place to make me lose a few hours is annoying.

Sometimes the dialogue options are all kinda bad or at least bland in the choices. Hard to choose anything if you have nothing you actually can agree with.

The accents really don't fit the game. Personally really disliked them. 

You can randomly lose companions. sometimes permanently. Worst part is they will keep all the gear they had in the inventory. (SPOILER. when you enter the well of ascension. if you just walk through the door instead of talking to all your characters first you lose them?? sure they got the icon that there is dialogue but all game that hasnt meant anything important. you also lose companions through other fairly random events if your not hardcore trying to follow the story but even then you cant know the first time..)

One of the most frustrating things about this game. Some checkpoints overwrite your own saves.. Like im not joking. itll start a boss fight and overwrite your last quicksave. If its your first time playing it will very likely end your game right there.. or make you go back several hours (SPOILER you wake up some ancient witch.. and at the start of the fight it overwrites the save. fight starts with a big aoe and your surrounded by wolves so unless you played it before you will likely lose)

The whole concept of only being able to do certain quests in a certain order. it is annoying. i have to spend ages looking for a quest my level when ive already explored the map 3 times. not to mention there are several maps. it can take the fun out

Overall you almost have to read guides in order to not meet any nasty surprises thanks to the bad design. It is fun and there is a lot of ways you can fight and all.. but a good game shouldn't be plagued by so many little problems.

Lots of fights seem far too prolonged - such as the Aeterea fight who gets unlimited summons of her dogs. Additionally, there are many ambush fights that kick off with little warning.

Combat is severely dumb downed to the point where you wonder whether the developers took the time to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the the combat in the previous title rather than saying screw it and strip the game of what it great in the first place and then slap a few bandaids on - 

Eg. in the first game, the player tended to simplify fights by locking down enemies with CC and whittling their HP down which led to a stale combat loops of applying CCs every turn while the enemies just stands there and stares at you. The only downside to such a strategy is that the CC abilities have a chance to miss and thus cannot be entirely relied upon. However, the developers apparently looked at that and thought to themselves- why not just implement a armor system where players would have to inflict enough damage to break that armor before they were able to apply the CCs onto the enemies? As it turns out, having armor on 99% of the enemies is a bad design choice(yes even puny little imps with no clothes on) have armor because why not) because it waters down the uniqueness and flavor of each ability in the game. You could have an potentially creative combo to approach a fight but NOPE, the spells just do the same thing as long as the enemy has their shields intact. Launching a boulder at the enemy's face has the EXACT same effect as firing an electric bolt from your fingertips thanks to this asinine armor system. Why even implement interesting synergistic spells when you handicap the player and prevent them from engaging with them? 

One might defend the new armor system by saying: just break the armor first then like the developers intended then do whatever you want to the enemies. But here lies the biggest problem- the process of stripping enemies' armor tends tear into the the actual HP bar and makes it so by the time the enemy is exposed; they are already at the brink of death so why not just invest everything purely into damage and kill the enemy before they can even react instead of figuring out synergies between different status effects. 

This leads to another glaring issue that I personally am surprised the developers have not discovered during playtest which is that the game is basically heavily incentivises the player to go all in on damage to kill off enemies before they can touch you and ignore defense because CC and status effects are impractical in this game because the enemies are able to chain CC you much more effectively that you can do the same to them due to them either overpowering you in terms of sheer numbers or simply having more action points in most fights. In fact, during my first playthrough, I had to respec my party to focus solely on damage rather than survivability for the unfair final boss battle and I ended up one shotting the boss on my first turn and skipping the second phase, which really goes to show the extent to which the game favors nuking the enemy and not playing the game any other way. Unfortunately for players who enjoy a bit of variety in their playstyles(tanks, healers, etc), this game does not seem to cater well to them at all.

== SPOILER ALERT ==
(Although, you do not want to spend 100 hours in the game spoiler free. You will not enjoy the ending.) 

== SPOILER ALERT ==

1. The ending might be the absolute worst ending I've ever seen in a video game. You get all kinds of foreshadowing about this epic battle coming at the end between the main characters, competing for divinity. You're told that there's no way around it, one and only one person must become Divine. 

You get to the final Big Bad. It's a good fight. There's a lot going on. You bring him down. Dialogue happens. Lots of normal RPG stuff so far. 

You go through the dialogue. Still normal stuff. Then you get one line of dialogue worth of advance notice. 

BLIP. 

You're in the supposedly epic final battle. No lead in. No prep time. No transition of any kind. You have not been here before, and the arena is not meaningful. It's just rocks and cliffs. 

That's it. 

THAT'S FUCKING ALL. 

Nothing else to the epic battle for divinity. No prep. No interesting conversations about the importance of it all with your companions. No chance to discuss and look for a peaceful solution. No 3rd option. Just one line of dialogue, a BLIP, and a generic arena. 

I'm not sure anything has shaken me out of enjoying a game as badly as this absolutely ruined ending. 


2. This is the game where I finally connected the dots and learned that I absolutely hate exponential item power scaling. 
You've all seen this before. Witcher 3 had it, WOW had it, Borderlands had it (much more evident at higher levels, usually in DLCs). You should watch out for this any time you have level requirements for items. 
In Divinity 2, you'll find that level 11 items feel about twice as powerful as level 10 items. It just gets worse from there. In order to keep your build feeling anywhere close to powerful enough for your level, you'll need to constantly hunt for equipment upgrades. Some items will look excellent for their level on paper, then be obsolete a half hour later on your next level up. 
This wrecks roleplaying systems. Witcher 3 was excellent, but when I started noticing that I had to replace my swords every level, I just lost interest. Geralt is not that kind of loot hound. It just does not fit. 
WOW always had odd problems around the edges with this. Remember level 19 arena twinks? Remember how they had some level 60 player running them through dungeons to try to find specific super-rare level 19 items? Yeah, we all knew that was bullshit. At its core, that was exponential item power scaling. 


2.5. I got kinda numb to it after probably spending 12+ hours of each playthrough simply organizing items, but therein lies the problem. The UI is clunky trash and inventory management is terrible. You should not spend this much time organizing items in any game, RPG, Factorio, or otherwise (and you don't have to in Factorio, at least not without interesting complex-automated-factory reasons). But, since your gear will go obsolete every single level, you have to. You have to find every scrap of gold you possibly can so that you can afford constant upgrades. So, you have to wade through the terrible inventory management. Good luck.",1709615504,1709615543,False,1,0,0.4823808073997497,0,True,False,False,False,435150,20250114_132026,negative,100

The prison cook attacks me; I swing my sword at him, and suddenly everything is on fire and half my party is asleep. The other half does no damage to the enemy, because armor mechanics are completely nonsensical.

I spend 4 hours researching how to do anything meaningful in the game. Reddit says that using a sword was my first mistake, and that the best warrior is actually a mage/archer combo, and that I was OBVIOUSLY supposed to stack Fire Flame 3 times, augmented by an Eternity Rune with a carbonized Greater Rift Dust glaze, then cast it on the nearest enemy's wool socks using a wand I should've already collected from a hidden spot where you need to click on exactly the right pixel to glitch up a cliff, and talk to British-voice NPC # 814.

You'll win every fight in like 2 turns, they say. But that build is only viable for the first 120 hours, then you have to switch to a rogue/summoner/butter knife combo to beat the last 41 bosses.

I awaken the next morning with a renewed sense of purpose & clarity. I create a new min-maxed character based on the internet's suggestions.

How 'bout where every hit is a foregone conclusion--for the enemy? 
 Do you like never being able to take anyone by surprise because Larian had never heard of the concept of a surprise round before making Baldur's Gate 3?  How 'bout a magic system where it's all friendly fire all the time, counterspells aren't a thing, and you can be cursed into doing damage with healing spells?  What about perpetually losing initiative on every character that's not your stabby-stabby sneakthief?  Environmental effects that can't be dispelled/mitigated except by long cooldown, high-use cost abilities?  Then boy howdy, do I have a game for you!

Your gear buys you one solid hit from the enemy, or perhaps two, before they're through either your magic armor or your physical armor.  Once your armor is gone, you're subject to status effects that range from annoying (bleeding, burning, cold, shocked) to TPK-inducing (stunned, knocked down, petrified, frozen, turned into a chicken--all the stuff that makes you lose at least one turn).  Your attacks, meanwhile, are shrugged off with relative ease bar the stabby stabby Rogue whenever they backstab a caster (casters have crappy physical armor and sky-high magic armor, Fighter types are the inverse, and Finesse guys get a balance of the two types).  The imbalance is such that one NPC can, with their full allotment of attacks, drop the armor of a given party member and leave them half dead in a single round.  Meanwhile, you have to focus fire with at least two characters (sometimes three) to be able to start CCing that enemy and pounding them into the ground.  Since you're virtually guaranteed to lose initiative unless you're rolling a full party of Rogues and it rains +Init gear and you're constantly buffing them with Clear Minded (and even then you'll probably lose more than win), congrats, you're fighting an encounter with 3 characters because whoever gets burned down in the opening round is fucked unless you can kill whoever's doing the damage fast enough (fat chance of that!).  Sure, maybe they won't be dead before it's their turn in the combat and they can down a potion and then not die, but if their status effect forces them to lose their turn or is accompanied by a DoT, they'll probably be dead before they get to act.

I've already restarted once when I realized my party as it stood was broken and completely incapable of winning fights.  I'm going to give the current crop of bullshit encounters another attempt and exploit Lone Wolf, and if that doesn't do it, then Larian can get bent and I'm uninstalling.

It has a nice combat system, interesting skills (much better than in the previous game). Some boss fights are cool too. The characters are... well... not fascinating, but, again, better, than in Original Sin 1.
The main minus is the game world. It just doesn't feel like it lives. It's more like an amusement park, where everything was made to entertain the player. Cities, for example, serve only 2 purposes: quest hub and shop. You want to buy a high-level spell? Go to a local market and buy it from a common merchant. Why this merchant in the center of the village of Driftwood has the spell that requires a source point to be casted? Why local magisters don't do anything with that?
Even Skyrim - absolutely soulless game - feels more ""lively"", than the Original Sin 2. At least there you couldn't buy high level spells from a market merchant - it was necessary to go to the college.
The game doesn't want you to explore the game world. Even more, it punishes you for that! Thinking about investigating of an interesting location? Forget about it - you'll be slaughtered by monsters in no time, if their level is at least 1 level higher, than yours. Players that like this game usually respond that you may use ton of exploits to win even in the most difficult battles. But the problem is, in order to use these exploits, you must use some very specific skills and very specific equipment, which seriously limits the enjoyment.
And another bad thing about the exploration. I remember how I, being level 18, found an amazing two-handed scythe in the Arx Cathedral. Excited, I equipped it at tried in combat. Well, it didn't go well - I was missing my targets constantly, because... the level of my weapon is too high. Damn, that's just illogical. I'm a level 18 warrior with 15 points in two-handed weapons. Why can't I use lvl 20 scythe? I could understand something like that in Diablo, where everything is about loot, but in an RPG it just looks not very good. The game should reward you for explorations, not punish you!
Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an interesting game, but only in terms of combat. The gameplay loop is extremely simple: go to a city, get as many quests as you can, follow the quest markers on your map to solve them, return back for your reward.

I'll start by saying the game has some strengths. The entire game is voice acted, which is nice. There're lots of NPCs to interact with, lots of quests to do, a class system complex enough for builders to work through. There is quite a bit of scope to plan your characters, and the option to play multiplayer is also nice (it is unique as well in all the RPGs I've played). It is highly nonlinear, and there are many ways to meet a quest objective. You can also kill (almost) any NPC, which completionists might find fun just to see how the plot reacts.

However, the game is also plagued with problems:

- The plot is very dry. I more or less lost track of it completely soon after arriving at Fort Joy. The game doesn't introduce what Source is, why Sourcerers are considered dangerous, what Fort Joy is, and so on (I actually learned this stuff from Wikipedia).
- The characters are very dry. I came to know my party members OK, but almost everyone else just fades out of memory. For example in the first zone there's a blue dragon, but what their name is I don't remember, or why they were shackled when I first met them. They're completely colorless and leave no impression, and I barely interacted with them.
- You do a lot of running around, but there's no fast travel beyond waypoints. After you've waypointed you still have to s-l-o-w-l-y walk to wherever you wanted to go (even worse if you split your party).
- Inventory management is tedious. It's not immediately obvious which items are junk, which are equipment, or even which are armor pieces and which are weapons. There's no way to search for which items add to a particular stat. Furthermore the items have weight, so you can't lug everything around, and there's no way to search for the heaviest items so you can drop them.
- Combat is also tedious. Even if you're level 8 and your opponents are level 2 - which means you kill them in 1 hit - you still have to go through the same turn-based combat, watching their animations.
- You also repeat the same tactics against most opponents, adding to the tedium.
- Even worse, combat is needlessly complex. I've lost count of the number of times I've friendly fired. Friendly fire in this game is not like casting a Fireball and having the edges of it hit my teammates, it's things like aiming the Fireball at an enemy and then having it hit my teammate because they were in the line of sight - there is no warning that this will happen. Similarly, I've stunned myself by casting lightning spells on something who's standing in a pool of water. I still haven't figured out if this always happens or if it's a percentage-based chance. Not having ""combat preview"" is an incredible drawback.
- There's no difficulty scaling. This means the game is less nonlinear than one might think, because you might not have the levels to do stuff in a different order.
- There's also a limited amount of enemies, which I suppose means there's no grind, but also means that, combined with the above, you should kill all the nonessential NPCs you can for loot and gold.

The upshot is this game has no plot, so there's no reason to play it for the story, and also tedious combat, so there's no reason to play it as an action game. Why play it then?

I expected DOS:2 to be somewhere in the middle, and that’s exactly what I got. If I had to describe this game in one word, it’d be ‘mid’.

If you want to read a lot of compliments, you’re probably better off reading a thumbs up review - but I’ll cover the positives in brief. DOS:2 is quite pretty, very long, and beautifully detailed. It has a ‘classless’ system that some people will find very refreshing, and the emphasis on surfaces in combat is a clever and unique approach to cRPG combat. It also does a really good job of making DOS:1 optional - you’ll understand everything you need to understand without playing the first one.

Much has been made of Larian’s character writing elsewhere, but unfortunately there aren’t many positives on display here. Your companions in particular are underwhelming - they’re uniformly edgy and shallow, with zero banter between party members. The Origin system lends them a bit more dimension, but I’d rather not have to make a character the protagonist before they’re interesting. The other characters are quite generic and forgettable. 

Combat is a strange beast - I thought BG3 had a problem with alpha strike gameplay, but in DOS:2 it’s the only approach possible. You [i]will[/i] run 3-4 pure dps characters, and you [i]will[/i] kill or be killed. You can make it easier on yourself pre-combat by laboriously moving all of your characters into ambush positions, prepping surfaces with poison or fire to make hazards, and other incredibly tedious micromanagement chores. Often, twenty minutes into a fight, you’ll figure out that you just don’t have the juice to win, and you’ll have to load a save to try your luck elsewhere. This feels as bad as it sounds.

Speaking of feeling bad, the dual armor system on enemies is incredibly restrictive and can render whole archetypes unexpectedly useless. Enemies have both physical and magical armour, and until you bust through at least one type, you don’t do damage to their health. This means you want a full party of physical damage dealers, or a full party of magical damage dealers, or you’ll run into problems. It limits your approach severely, and your approach was already limited by the encounter design!

Perhaps you’ll think to look at consumables in order to give you some extra tools to handle the tedious, demanding combat. Well, there’s a lot of stuff in the game - too much, often with underwhelming or duplicate effects. Very little of it has a significant impact in combat. As for gear, there’s a ton of that too, but it’s mostly of the ‘randomly generated stats’ variety. Gold is a huge issue at the start unless you steal, and then so abundant that stealing becomes pointless. The whole gearing and consumables system feels bloated and shallow, not helped by the terrible inventory management interface that I’ve come to expect from Larian games at this point. 

But the worst of DOS:2, the cardinal sin (if you’ll pardon the pun) is the pacing. The open-ended, meandering design is a massive weakness. You’ll be spending the vast majority of your time wandering across the map, avoiding overleveled encounters and trying to find something that you can actually handle at your level and gear. Nothing is signposted, and your quest log is insufferably vague. The designers have a very specific order that they expect you to do things in, and they expect you not to skip anything, but they’ll be damned if they indicate those expectations to you through any method other than death. Without a guide, progress is impossibly slow.

Whilst the creativity and dedication shown is admirable, DOS:2 is crippled by poor choices. Its glaring shortcomings ruin what could have been a quality experience.",1710646264,1710646264,False,7,1,0.4759305417537689,0,True,False,False,False,435150,20250114_132026,negative,100

I played Baldurs Gate 3 before, and world wise it really holds its own. Although it feels lower budget (lacking animations and VA.) I feel the love and passion in this game that went into building the masterpiece a few years down the line. The first 20 hours(fort joy) are absolutely amazing, making you think its a masterpiece. 

However, this game is not a masterpiece. After act 1 I seriously struggled getting through it. This game does not hold your hand. It does not even teach you the ropes, in fact it throws you in the pool as an infant and expects you to swim, it also never lets up. The combat for one(classic), was always a struggle. Never through out the story are you at parity with the enemies. They are always a few levels ahead oneshotting you. With that youd expect encouragement with smart creative gameplay? No, the pathfinding is absolutely atrocious, in ways that make you wanna pull your hair out. Wanna shoot an arrow or spell at an enemy ever? A 5 inch fence will block you when, a puddle of piss is apparently an obstacle when you are shooting STRAIGHT. With that, the level design is horrid, often boxing you in and not letting you use your abilities in any meaningful way while the AI gets advantage on almost every incline and gap through a wall. Oh and how dare I forget about the elements, there are barrels everywhere, and EVERY encounter turns into a California forest fire. You could be in the ocean and still catch on fire! Really, the game practically begs you to cheat every fight with how tedious they are. The funny thing is your supposed to be Godwoken!

Its not only the combat that is unforgiving and tedious. Much of the games stories and content devolves into a ""how the hell would I know that?"" while playing. I've never had to use a guide until this game, where there are multiple missions which require a hyper specific thing to advance. One requiring a painting across the map to be placed on a pedestal and there was 0 guidance by the story. I like choices, but when most of the quests turn into an OJ simpson investigation as the player searches every random text, it gets tedious.

I can tell this was made with love and passion and thats what counts... but I suppose playing BGS3 beforehand left a harsh taste in my mouth which is not fair to the game completely. Thats the thing, BGS3 fixed every problem I mentioned above, so ive played and seen better. Seriously if not for the aggravating combat, its up there for the first act.

I wish I hadn't.

Acts 1 and 2 are phenomenal.  They aren't free of flaws or bugs, but they are few and far enough between that none stick out more than the others.  Act 3 is when things start to turn.  The Godwoken are powerful.  It seems they were more powerful than Larian knew what to do with.  Enemies begin breaking established rules in combat, doing things the player is incapable of, and using far more action points than the player will ever have access to in a single turn.  Act 4, combat wise, is an absolute joke.  Act 3's poor combat choices just compound on themselves to the point that combat became something I would dread and get through as quickly as possible.  Not because it was difficult, but because it fucking sucked.  The only good part of Act 4 was Lohse's personal quest, which I won't be spoiling here.  Act 4 did however ensure that I will NEVER play this game again.  It quite honestly ruined the entire game for me.

However, it gets bogged down by being too open and too detailed, with unfun combat and a focus on TTRPG flavored rules over the full TTRPG experience. Its not a bad game, but there are other games that do it better. If you like a lot of crunch in your rpg, this might be great for you. Just wasn't for me.   

I want to start by saying I don't think DOS2 is a bad game. Larian put a ton of work into this game and it shows. The attention to detail is mind blowing, and the open-ended/non-linear structure of the game play is impressive. The tactical combat is very robust and well rounded, with some unique ideas that make DOS2 stand out from other top-down rpg's. And if you're looking for a game that makes you feel like you're playing Dungeons & Dragons or a similar TTRPG, DOS2 nails it. 

That said, I think the game's strength's also act as it's weaknesses as well:

1. There is a little too much detail.
There is so much going on in this game. From deep world building to a huge cast of background characters to numerous ways to approach any given situation. But across my 85-hours of play, I found myself saying ""wait who were you again?"" or ""what was I supposed to do here?"" over and over. I'm used to juggling multiple quest-lines and characters but DOS2 has so much going on that it feels awkward. When it all lines up, its cool, but it just as often feels bloated. And with so much going on, its difficult to care. 

2. Free-range doesn't always equal fun.
It would have been fun to be in the room when someone said, ""you can't do that in a video game"" only for Larian to say ""challenge accepted!"" The fact that they managed to give you so many ways to approach travel, combat, and quest lines is a masterclass in innovation. That said, the openness never really feels like its serving the narrative, but just exists for its own sake. Now sandboxes can be incredibly fun, but the narrative of DOS2 doesn't really line up with that experience. I had multiple experiences where I would take time exploring and stumbling into quests, only to return to the main quest line only to discover that those ""side-quests"" were actually a part of the main quest, and that I had unknowingly closed off some narrative options. Now I like games that enforce consequences for your actions, but if those consequences aren't communicated, it just starts to feel like the story is punishing your for embracing the gameplay.

3. The combat is relentless and unforgiving.
DOS2 embraces tactical/turn-based combat, and you really have to think about what you are doing. Now there's nothing wrong with that per-say, but the game understands the system better than most players (myself included) and one mistake even on normal difficulty can lead to brutal consequences. And there's just so many dumb ways to die. Even outside of combat you have to keep your guard up. Its like playing Dungeons & Dragons with a mean DM. Someone who's idea of fun is to make a every encounter a lethal encounter. There's never a challenge or combat that exists to make you feel cool or just have fun. Its always a pop-quiz with some new and exciting way to screw you over. Combined with the bloated number of mechanics you have to hold in your brain at every moment, DOS2's combat is exhausting.

4. DOS2 captures the essence of TTRPG rules, but not the essence of the TTRPG fun.
 As I said, the game does a great job of adapting TTRPG's to the video game format, but it constantly feels like a game being DM'd by a rules-lawyer who really needs you to understand the details of their home-brewed D&D setting before you can play (and seeing as I have been that DM in the past, I should know!). I never got the feel of 'fun' that I've had with TTRPG's. The main story is vague and never really gives you reason to care beyond ,""you just should because you're the chosen one"". The companions only come in three flavors of morally grey edge-lord stereotype, and I never felt like I would be missing anything without them in the game.

All in all, I think this is an ambitious game that accomplishes some impressive technical feats, at the cost of the overall experience. If you're the sort of player that enjoys crunchy rules and combat over narrative and user experience, than this game is for you. Otherwise I would suggest Pillars of Eternity I & II.

Ona minute you are stranded and are learning how to do a knife-n-a-string recipe so that you can add up one extra damadge point to your weapon and in a minute the ""world"" opens to you, and random NPC are either bothering you (hey you, you look like a lad that can take this quest) or are clearly just sitting there for you to ""solve"" their problems (a woman weeping, muttering something about husband that is too long away). Sorry but this is shitty writting. 
Then you have a journal full of anmes and places and alternative options how to solve something but everything is basically a fetchquest. 

in one instance I palyed coop and we got an item that cen teleport us. there was a beach underneath the cliff and the guy told e to teleport him to another side. well we teleported him to the beach below, he went angry , run away and our quest was unsucesfull. ...ah, the guy meant that we should teleport him even further away to a shipping mole? well you got one shot and if you didnt understood the assignement you can savescum.

Yeah, heard that line way to much and got fooled by this statement, to me it's easily the weakest one I played as well as the first one I never do a second run for and I even had to make a break because it drags on forever, heck! I was even about to make a second break a few hours before the ending because it's no fun at all! But why is such a priced game so crappy you may ask? Well here goes, and since it's rated up so heavily, I focus on the issues rather than the good, there are enough of those after all:

Annoying bugs: With a game that scale, it's only logical, but how come my character freezes randomly and never ever moves again until saving and reloading the game? This was so often it's just ridiculous! Some quests were broken or never triggered as well, so that's just great..

Clutter clutter clutter: Oh god! The sheer amount of s**t in this game you can pick up and carry around is overwhelming! But in a negative way.. Other games toss garbage into said category and you can one-click sell the junk, not here! As a matter of fact you don't even know if that ""junk"" might not be a quest item or otherwise essential. Better yet, you can sell quest items! Got me puzzled for an hour, why I couldn't finish a quest and later to which freaking merchant I sold this junk item to. On the other hand, misc items with minor use for a short while will be marked unsellable forever for some reason and clutter up your overflowing inventory further! WTF??

Thievery: It's impossible to not steal something in this game, but not because it's so incredible, but because the infinite junk laying around on the floor makes it difficult to never steal something. Stealing a freaking bucket may even lead to you fighting the entire town and slaughtering them all, dooming it to become a ghost town over a goddamn bucket or spoon you never wanted! On the bright side, pickpocket is actually worthwhile! NPCs have some neat stuff in their inventory, that seem to break upon death, so forget about the dozens of items and thousands of gold, when they die, it's almost all gone! What's with this? Also pickpocketing leaves NPCs searching for the thief, which can be hilarious at first, like when you are in a vault, that would bring a prepper to proudful tears and for some reason you can easily convince them you haven't stolen them and they keep on searching, despite there being no one else! But forced conversations (multiple sometimes) over some junk gets dull really fast.

Insta-Death & infinite waves of enemies: Yeah, you got that one covered as well! The most fun thing in a strategy game! Insta-death surfaces leave your character dead on the ground and reviving them will immediately kill them again, so your only option to solve this BS is to load a previous game, super fun! in act 4 the game keeps hurling infinite encounters at you for some reason, that leave you with so much frustration, that you keep wondering why you still bother with this sh**show anymore! Even better, the encounter before the final boss is infinite and you can only get past by quickly solving the puzzle (or install an essential mod) and quickly rush past those possessed muppets (yes, they are puppets) and to top it off: the goddamn puppets are harder to battle than the final boss, which I brought down so quickly, that I thought, there would come much more, nope..

Multiplayer: Yes, the game has it! But why is it a reason to be so frustrated? Well firstly, when launching the game (without skip launcher option) you are greeted with a crappy launcher, that demands you create an account. You can only press skip once you click create account - every single time! Once this nonsense has been dealt with, it's clear this game was hardly meant for SP, since every character has their very own reputation and conversation with NPCs, which makes you scratch your head, why your main char is so precious, to get that source collar removed, but those who helped in the arena are practically worthless scum! In addition to that, you may end up your party not following you for some reason, so you always have to watch out for them to actually follow along and they even end up with forced conversations with no hope of passing any checks, because your persuasive char has once again been ignored.. Had this with act 1, where one char was force greeted without me noticing until I was in a battle and him missing, only to end up in a fight after the conversation was finished, so 2 battles simultaneously! What's wrong with this bulls***???

Seriously, how can something like this be so highly rated when there are games like Wasteland, Pillars of Eternity or Shadowrun around? And to think they made BG3, another overrated game, ugh.. I won't get this thing unless entirely for free, with how poorly this game is made. Also a must avoid for vision impaired gamers, wished I never found a mod to increase the text scale and refunded the game to spend the money on poorly received dlc for another, actually great CRPG..

And as a new player to this genre of game, for new players, I say this is a skip. The game has a lot of fumbles with it. You would think that when playing a DND type game that you are going to create your own character, class, etc and you can do that. But you are only going to get away with that if you play on the most basic difficulty because the enemies are weak and as a first time player you are not going to know where to allocate your points into what stats.

So me and my friends played on the standard normal difficulty and things led to many things that break the so called immersion of this game. Save scumming because we did not like certain quests ending the way they did, dying because the enemies take away your armor in one hit, not positioning properly for a fight you didn't even know was about to break out and get AOE to death, and persuasion checks that are pointless if you succeed them, you're still going to fight. So that adventure got canned and never finished.

So then I did a solo run, still can't play the way I want to, so I default to what everyone does, look up builds. Now I am not playing a game the way I want to play, I am playing just to beat it and the builds work. Now we go even deeper issues with this game. Enemies, your class skills need to be properly tuned and fixed with a patch. I don't care how old this game is, enemies being blocked by a house door or being behind furniture or something in the house and they have line of sight to attack me, but then I try to shoot them with my ranger no line of sight. Enemies clipping terrain, now you can't crowd control and knock them down to negate some damage. For the people that like to be immersed in these type of games, how can you be when 90% of the NPC's are rude as **** forcing you to become not the hero but just someone that gets things done with so much blood on your hands. NPC's you helped in the past act like they've never seen you or saw you help them in the past and sometimes see you have something of their's ""Give it to me! Or your life."" You want another example. ""You helped me and I've given you my thanks, now p*** off.""

- The soundtrack is nice, not annoying and doesent really gets repetitive
- The dialogue writing is generally good, you can talk to almost any animal as well.
- The game is dirt cheap, is dirt though.
- The starting location and the end location are actually having interesting quests.
- World design has a lot of potential, devs left it to your imagination, though. 

Mixed:
- Puzzles. Some are overly complex, others bugged, third are too simple. I liked some, was very annoyed by others. 

Cons:
- Combat. It is heavily dependent on your characters level. Oh, you're one level off? A shame, grind in a single player game. Its also very weirdly balanced, where some enemies are just made to be ridiculously difficult, while others are pushover. Oh and thanks for the enemies who can only die after using a certain spell with 2 round cooldown, can run away from you across the whole map, immune to most magic and so on. 
The whole game is just artificial difficulty, with no elaborate combat. That is explorer mode; the only difference with harder difficulty is that boring combat lasts 10 minutes instead of 3 hours. 
- Characters' art looks different than their game model. They never tried to even make them look alike. [b] One of many overlooks by the devs [/b]
- A couple of locations are abysmally bad. Oversized, empty, and you just have to fight through a lot of copy pasted enemies to find... nothing (Wrecker's Cave as a very good example of this). 
- Romance is very plain, and when it comes to intercourse — devs didn't even care to make your character remove the armor. (you can do that manually, though, do what you paid developers to do) 
-  Endings are very underwhelming. Your romance is not reflected, its very rigorous and mostly depends on just one choice. Surprisingly, side characters seem to have more variety than main characters... yeah. Oh and the ending cutscene is just awful, especially when it touches upon the same subject thrice in a row. 
- Interface is awful, one of the worst I ever faced in a game. Its not complex, but very inconvenient and poorly designed. Comes with unusual key mapping so that you press L to look up the quests.
- Bugs like Han disappearing. 
- Why would you make a purging wand give you a skill that purges instead of just purging? 
- Why some weapons have hp (amount of uses), and others dont? Its not even connected to balance, its just there. It doesent add any difficulty as well since you can just buy a ton of repair kits. 
- Only a handful of choices in the game matter. There are certain enemies that you can do 3 good skill checks in a row... to only find that the outcome is the same no matter what you pick.
- Quests go like this - Do X, get ambushed. Or you find out that this character had some bad motives and you can either kill them or leave them be.

My biggest complaint is that I felt very constrained for an RPG; it seemed like the game wanted to me take quests/encounters in a very specific order, and ""side"" quests often felt mandatory to get strong enough to defeat the main quest's next encounter. Experience and good items were very scarce, while difficulty spikes were prevalent from start to finish; many encounters quickly overwhelmed me with raw stats and required hours of trial and error (And worse, backtracking) to defeat.

On top of that, the turn-based combat felt painfully slow; even against unimportant lackeys, a single fight usually took 5+ minutes to clear at least. Long, unskippable animations play out for almost everything, no matter how unimportant. And considering that fights often have 8+ characters taking turns one at a time, it adds up fast.

The combat does have a lot of potential for complex interactions between abilities; you can spill oil on an enemy and then light them on fire, soak them in water and then shock them with lightning, and sometimes instantly kill enemies with certain environmental hazards; this can make a lot of encounters much easier if you're willing to spend long enough strategizing and prepping.

But it just wasn't enough to really grab me, especially because I often couldn't just come back later if there was an encounter I was struggling with; I'd simply run out of other ways to get experience and items. I finished the game once, can't remember most of the plot, and I mostly remember the campaign for being a frustrating chore.

I just could not enjoy this game's combat.

What about exploration? You go to a door, try to open it. It's locked. You try to pick the lock; your rogue's skill is too low, and your precious lockpick is gone forever. So you try to break it; now your weapon's durability is shot and it's unusable in combat. You unequip your weapon, and punch and kick the door. A hundred kicks later, it's open, and you can go into a room and pick up like 2 gold, which is a tiny fraction of what it costs to buy another lockpick. Who the hell thought this was a good idea?

What about the characters, setting and story? Setting and story look interesting, but I didn't get very far, so I can't tell for sure. Some characters were alright, others I just wanted to murder for being total pieces of shit, like the Red Prince. I didn't actually like any of the origin companions though, like I did instantly like Lae'zel in BG3. D:OS 2 companions were just... okay, at best. Which is not too bad, and I'm sure they have interesting storylines down the road, but it's not good enough to keep me engaged and playing a game whose gameplay I've flatly disliked.

Clearly, many players enjoy this game, if you look at its excellent review scores... but just as many players are like me, who did not enjoy it. D:OS 2 has 97 achievements, and only 8 of them have been completed by over 50% of players. I quit halfway through exploring Fort Joy, the first town you get to right after the prologue, and got multiple achievements that only 30 or 40% of players have gotten. More than half of all players quit this game very, very early- they just don't bother to be like me, and leave a negative review on the way out.

However, this game in it's current state has not been kept up by Bethesda to be a usable product any more. 
 It's not patched to run on Windows 10 (or above? I'm on 10), there seems to be such a common trend with many users experiencing crashes.. it's a shame.  I really wanted to play this again.  I just purchased the Ultimate package (even tho I already owned New Vegas without the DLC and wasn't getting an extra discount for owning the main game already) so I could play it through again, check out the new content, and generally take more time at it than my first run-through.  BUT, THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE.  This game crashes several times an hour.  After following Bethesda's advice from their website (the usual, update drivers, go into compatibility mode, etc.) that didn't work.  I did find some guides on installing a bunch of mods and such, but WOW.  I thought I was into the game, but I'm not about to spend HOURS installing utilities and mods to get this thing working.  For some it may be worth it, those that have given feedback seem to say installing all that stuff does get rid of the crashes.

TLDR; If you do not want to spend hours patching/installing mods (that are not done by Bethesda btw) then it may be worth it to purchase this in it's current state.  For me, a huge fallout fan, it's ABSOLUTLY NOT WORTH IT.  R.I.P. New Vegas.  I'm bummed about that.

I don't know if it's a recent update that caused this, or if the game doesn't like Windows 10, but Fallout: New Vegas is the most user-hostile game I've played. Booting it up again, 5 years later, now with all of its DLCs, that I regret purchasing, the game would crash literally every single hour. With no mods installed. I had to download a certain patch, just to stop it from crashing, and it did... HOWEVER... then it refused to save my game, because Windows thought the game was a virus, so I had to deal with that... AND THEN... because that wasn't enough, naturally the game decides to randomly corrupt all of your save games. All of them. Game just gets stuck on the loading screen forever.

Some of the glitches/bugs I have encountered include:
-Stuttering
-Interiors not loading (invisible walls or floors)
-Random fps drops
-Everything (player and npcs) rubber-banding in place (still have no clue how to describe this)
-And the classic CTD

 - The game is quite buggy; some NPCs don't do what they're supposed to in quests, and/or you don't get credit for completing the quests even after you've done everything you're supposed to
- The quests themselves can get quite confusing, as there are quests-within-quests, etc., and sometimes it's hard to keep track of what you're supposed to be doing
- The direction arrows for (supposedly) guiding you to people and/or places that you're supposed to go to or interact with to complete quests are maddeningly vague and hard to interpret
- The game keeps crashing my Win11 system, by locking-up so that I have to re-boot my machine each time it does. I'll grant that this probably isn't the developers' fault, but it's a heads-up to anyone thinking of playing this game on a Win11 OS

In summary, it's not a bad game; as I said, I've spent may hours playing it, and had some fun doing so. But, the problems therein make it a game that I won't tell people NOT to play it, but go in with eyes open that there are some bugs that can make it pretty frustrating.

For an old fogey like me, the biggest thing to get used to is the combat. While BG and BG2 were turn-based with pause, BG3 is fully turn-based; where BG2 was based on D&D 2e and 3e, BG3 is based on 5e. Since I had no tabletop experience with it before this game, it also served as an introduction to 5e for me (or at least Larian's house-ruled version, as changes are inevitable when you're translating a game from pen and paper to computer). So a lot of this review is actually going to be about that, too.

I was skeptical when I heard that despite its length, the game topped out at 12th level (BG1's low level combat was extremely one-sided, and BG2 [i]starts[/i] at 8-10, depending on class) and that your party had no more than 4 people (down from 6), but as it turns out this is mostly compensated for by the deepened combat system. Mobility and positioning are far more important now, since movement is restricted each turn and enemies make far better use of theirs. Spell-like abilities are far more abundant, meaning pure spellcasters are not as impressive/overpowered as they used to be. Battles are now much more an exercise into correctly applying the limited use of every character's vast pool of options, rather than the classic ""mage and fighter meat shields"" setup of most BG2 battles. Both systems have their pros and cons, but the 5e system is a lot more balanced between classes if nothing else. Though, if you like your fights absolutely unbalanced and unfair, BG3 has plenty of options for that as well, mostly by abusing the physics system in ways I'm sure a tabletop DM would never allow.

Speaking of classes, that's been completely overhauled too, with the ability to pick a class on every level, rather than the mechanically more complicated and restricted multiclassing and dualclassing from 2e/3e. This is a fun and versatile system that allows you to mix and match proficiencies and abilities to build a character you like without being dependent on having a specific kit designed for them. One thing that holds back the fun somewhat is that the game's length means you will be at the lower levels for a [i]long[/i] time, so if you have a build planned that only really comes into its own at the later levels you'll be waiting on that quite a bit. You do get access to a cheap and easy way to respec your character early in the game, so switching builds depending on their viability at each stage is an option.

In terms of the actual combat in the game, the biggest hurdle is understanding the system and the action economy (there are ""actions"" and ""bonus actions"" and they are mostly not interchangeable), but once you do most fights pose little problem. There are only a handful of fights I would call challenging, and even on the highest difficulty levels you will find yourself with an inventory full of weapons, items and consumables that you don't need to win. The main thing making the game's hardest difficulty setting ""honour mode"" a true challenge is that you have to do it all on a single save, which enforces extreme caution. I personally prefer just having tougher but replayable battles over an ironman mode, but fortunately the game is very moddable, so there's options if you want the game harder, or trivialize combat entirely so you can focus on the story.

Combat mechanics aside, the role-playing part is where it gets really fun. Whereas the standard approach in most RPGs is fighting, or getting a quest item, or getting a quest item by fighting, BG3 leans a lot more into your character's background and proficiencies, and relies on abundant dice rolls for everything. Skipping things or doing them out of order is practically the norm, and the game is built to handle it. When it's firing on all cylinders, the game feels like an actual tabletop session of D&D, where your party pulls outrageous stunts (and/or spectacular failures) based on how the dice favored their crazy ideas, while the DM wearily looks on and rewrites campaign notes in the background. There is still plenty of combat and a few major places where fighting your way out is unavoidable, but these stand out when contrasted with how often you can talk or physically manipulate your way out of things. As with any CRPG there are still always places where you wished you had more options, but the game does a good job of accommodating you.

So is the game perfect then? Well, no, nothing is. It's very, very good, but there are blemishes. Small physics, camera and UI glitches that are fortunately mostly resolved by saving and loading the game. A classic if by now a bit antiquated approach to loot where the game showers you with magical items, but most of them are not very interesting or impressive and get chucked on the pile. Some mechanics, while adding flavor, feel tacked-on and inconsequential -- camp supplies, alchemy, dyes. There are cameos from companions in earlier games, but the story doesn't gel very well with how things were left at the end of the Bhaalspawn saga. There are weaknesses around the storyline if you want to play an ""evil"" character, with ""good"" characters definitely getting to see and do more. And while the game's immense size is surely hard to fault in terms of value for money, it does mean that by Act Three, when your course is pretty well set and it seems like things are ramping up to a confrontation, the game still throws new side quests at you like you're just starting out, which can lead to fatigue if you're not able to simply plow ahead and ignore them. 

So with all that, do I recommend BG3? ...are you kidding? If the many other reviews didn't already give you an indication, BG3 is an RPG with phenomenal and probably unparalleled scope, size, depth and quality, and more importantly, the ability to pull you in and keep you hooked. I've spent many a day going to bed far later than I should have just because there was ""one more quest"" to finish up, ""one more area"" to explore, and before I knew it I was neck deep into new shenanigans. It brought me all the way back to a time where BG2 was, for a long time, the only game I played, to the point where I learned all the ins and outs of the engine and even made a few mods for it myself. I'm (probably!) not going to go that far for BG3, but it definitely gave me the same feeling of wanting to go for another playthrough almost immediately after I'd finished the first one, even knowing how many hours that was going to take, just to do things differently this time. That time commitment is definitely not for everyone, as shown by the fact that no less than [i]half[/i] of all players don't even make it through Act One, but this game is so large that even just Act One would qualify as a full price release on its own for most studios. Not so Larian, and while they've broken many hearts by saying there won't be an expansion or sequel to BG3, by the end of this game you definitely feel the weight of all that effort and time the developers sank into it, and you can't really blame them for going ""enough"".

[i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is a game I think everyone should play, even if you don't complete it. Those who like CRPGs will almost certainly love it, those who have never played CRPGs may come to like the genre, and all in all this game is probably the best advertisement for [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] outside of the source material.

At first, it didn't grab me. 
With no prior experience playing Dungeons & Dragons and not being a fan of turn-based combat, I struggled to connect with the game. The mechanics felt foreign, and I found myself drifting away to play other titles.

But something about Baldur's Gate 3 kept pulling me back. I gave it another shot, and then, it clicked. 
I started to enjoy the combat, figuring out how to use the environment to my advantage, and I realized just how much influence you can wield outside of battle. Conversations, choices, and strategies became just as important as swinging a sword or casting a spell.

I became invested in the characters, more than I have in any other game. Well, most of them — I don't like Wyll. His story just felt underwhelming compared to the others. Each companion had depth and complexity that kept me hooked. The freedom the game offers is truly unparalleled. I could shape my own story in ways that felt meaningful. I found myself losing track of time, wanting to know what would happen next.

Fast forward 150 hours(!), and I’ve just finished my first playthrough. Without a doubt, this is the best game I’ve ever played, and I’ve played a LOT of games. The sense of emptiness it leaves behind is almost painful. All I want to do is dive back in and start a new run. (Taking suggestions on what character or class to try next)

In summary, yes, I wholeheartedly recommend Baldur's Gate 3. It’s an unforgettable experience that sets a new standard for storytelling and player agency in games.

This totally changes the game, allowing you to use standard 3rd person camera controls, and actually see what's ahead when moving up-hill.

It turns out all outdoor areas have sky boxes (including sun and moon), and almost all interior areas have ceilings.  Trust me, you'll hardly notice the few times a ceiling is missing or ""pops in"", unless you're looking for it.  And there's no performance hit that I've noticed.

Makes me wander why Larian didn't give an unlocked camera by default...

D.R. this is one of the best games ever created and deserve every single award it won.

My first playthrough of Baldur's Gate III took over 250 hours to complete, just by walking around, interacting with party members, NPCs, trying to complete every quest, testing different builds. Yet the game never felt like it was padding.

It's no wonder a lot of AAA devs complained that this game overdelivers, because it does in all aspects. You can truly see the passion and dedication of Swen and his team with this title because it's just so freaking massive; yet by the end of final Act you're still left craving for more, wanting to explore more of this beautifully crafted world and characters.

[h1]Strengths[/h1]

✅ This game provides a fantastic, almost accurate experience of 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. The devs had to adapt a lot of the rules to fit the game format but if you've played DnD before then this will be easy to grasp.

✅ I think the best part of this game is how much freedom you have to tackle on challenges and fights. For example, I play a lot of Stealth Strategy games (like Commandos, Desperados and Shadow Tactics), so I really enjoy setting up my party members to dispatch bosses with few actions as possible while striking with one character after the other while hiding. There is a lot of player expression you don't see in any other game.

✅ The character writing of this game reminds me a lot of BioWare's, which is poetic considering that Baldur's Gate I & II were made by them. Nearly all character arcs feel satisfying. I've been craving for a game like this since the Mass Effect Trilogy. Also, if you've played the original Baldur's Gate games, prepare for some nice surprises.

✅ The replay value of this game is absolutely gargantuan, because there are different routes, quest outcomes and small details that carry changes through the rest of the game. Not to mention different classes to experience. You'll often find yourself tempted to start fresh new save files to restart your journey with different classes, and I don't blame you.

✅ The fact this game has, on top of all that, FULLY FUNCTIONAL ONLINE MULTIPLAYER WITH UP TO FOUR PEOPLE, is the cherry on top. Being able to play this game with friends (and struggling to align the schedules) is ridiculously fun and further adds replay value.

✅ The modding community is very active and Patch 7 (September 3rd, 2024) even added an official mod  manager and support in-game.

[h1]Weaknesses[/h1]

❌ Even on the lowest settings performance can sometimes tank a bit in large populated areas. You may see a significant drop in FPS. But overall this game is very well optimized.

❌ I feel this game could've done a better job with some of the tutorials. For instance, you can fail or even downright miss quests if you long rest too much depending on which part of the game you are.

❌ The game rewards ""murder hobo'ing"" a bit too much. You still get experience for milestones (discovering new locations, completing quests without killing, etc.), but if you want to maximize experience gained it's easier to just slaughter everything.

❌ The final Act feels a bit lackluster in some aspects, not to mention the gauntlet of fights leading to the final battle being a bit disappointing. No spoilers but I was expecting something more way more flashy and bombastic.

And while I understand people who say that you shouldn't expect games like this from other developers because not everyone is willing to invest so much in their creations due to huge risks, that shouldn't be an excuse for the degradation we've seen in RPGs from AAA companies in recent years.

I love how Larian Studios put so much heart into this game. They even added an NPC based on a fan's story from Twitter. The fan thanked them for bringing a D&D set that he played with his dad when he was a kid, and they made an NPC that looks just like his dad. It's so touching and shows how much they care about their players.

They also fix bugs really quickly, sometimes within hours or days, which is awesome.

The only downside for me is the same freedom I love. Sometimes it's hard to decide what to say or do next because there are so many choices. It's a bit overwhelming at times.

(Spoiler free)

[h1] Summary [/h1]

I don't play story games for very long, if it's 8 hours long, I will play it for 8 hours, even if it's a genuinely amazing game, there is no way to re-experience my first interaction with a title I love, any reruns would just dilute my memory of it.

That said, this is different. This isn't just a story game, this is a narrative masterpiece, mechanically almost perfect and the single longest amount of time I've ever spent on a game of this nature. I struggle to keep hooked on high fantasy but this game exceeded every single expectation I had from the genre.

In short, the game is a turn-based RPG, with dense player interaction, dialogue, story, and an absolute treasure chest when it comes to variety, the combat is practically a sandbox, only limited by your creativity when it comes to turning goblins and human alike into a puddle where their torso used to be.
You're immediately given a fairly substantial task upon first loading in and it's your goal to progress through the story with the aim of resolving it. 
However, the steps you take along your path to resolving it entirely shifts the dynamic of whole regions and thus how people treat you as you progress through the story. Eventually, the major task you have becomes a footnote as you're thrown knee-deep into something much larger than you ever anticipated. 
Of course, how it actually DOES resolve, whether for the betterment of everyone you've met along the way or to achieve absolute power is entirely up to you.. but you might often find yourself making choices with a special party member in mind ;)

Oh and the CO-OP is absolutely unreal, it from experience (with a good host) works absolutely perfectly and I've essentially completed the entire story 3 times with entirely different groups of people, each time yielding its own absolutely chaotic outcome. It does seriously impact how you interact with companions though as there are a limited number of party slots, so don't take your CO-OP play-through as your sole experience of the game.

[h1] Characters [/h1]

Phenomenal writing, it's very easy to dismiss the companions you find along the way as being relatively abrasive or otherwise uninteresting, but as you progress through the story they begin to open up to you as your relationship (dictated by your actions, through dialogue, interactions with the world or quest outcomes) grows, and thus you gain major introspective with the character. 
Every companion has their own quirk, something that they personally want to resolve by the end of the game. If you choose to ignore them they may never achieve that without your help, and potentially abandon you, or worse. 
They all react differently to how you roleplay your character, some despising signs of empathy while others seriously admiring it, it creates a situation where the dynamic of your party isn't always relying on you picking the ""morally good"" answers to get a desirable outcome.. ahem Starfield >.> 
Some companions even outright love evil acts, and will encourage you to do them.. oh and of course there's romance so that's always a win if you want to romance someone with the bloodlust of a bag of angry hornets.

Additionally, the non-essential or non-playable characters you find beyond your own party are all intricate in their own right. Some are a little sparser content-wise than others but everyone typically always has something to say, often in regards to events you've caused or partaken in. Even if you don't cross their paths early on, they often show up with unique dialogue later, often remarking about how your actions led them to where they are.
Something I especially enjoy is that often you'll keep seeing characters you save or aid throughout the entire length of the game, gradually finding new ways to give aid back or just give you a little insight to story each time you find them.
A very notable example (without sharing too much detail) is saving a character in something I originally thought was a throw-away gag, where if you choose to (or accidentally) kill them just by pushing the wrong button, it not only locks off a major outcome of a literal end-game quest but makes another entire quest-line marginally harder. Your choices DO matter even if it isn't immediately obvious.

Finally, the ""bad guys"" in this game are probably my favourite in all of high fantasy media, and while there is an implied major boss that you're seeking out, there's a multitude of equally plot essential bosses you find with their own backstories, and beyond that, even the non-essential bosses are all very fun to fight, all with their own gimmicks which invite you to switch up your playstyle.

Plus, J. K. Simmons, the voice of Cave Johnson, Omni-Man, Stanford Pines.. the yellow M&M for some reason, and basically hundreds of other characters you'll recognise voices my single favourite boss in the whole game.

[h1] Story [/h1]

Dense, utterly dense, packed with scenarios, people to meet, people to kill, people to revive for reasons of questioning them about who killed them. 
Quite frankly, 500 hours of content is barely scratching the surface, I'm doing a brand new run as of right now and still discovering things I've never seen before. 
There is a deep level of world-building, both direct and indirect, physical and implied, entire regions are impacted by actions delivered long before you even arrived, some are more dangerous than others for explicit plot reasons. There's little stories and quests to be found in the most obscure of places, each with differing outcomes.

I don't think I could ever do the story justice in this section so I won't further elaborate, experience it yourself.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Really not what I expected when I first got into the game, I was a little sceptical because I don't much care of the RPG formula of having all your actions as little buttons at the bottom of your screen, I especially didn't think I would much care for a top-down turn-based point and click style experience.

However, I am genuinely captivated, it isn't just a combat system, it's a sandbox. Every class drastically changes how you approach issues, from getting the perfect position to fireball as a squishy wizards/sorcerers so you don't die first turn, to just paladin charging face first at any inconvenience, and it hitting it with a 7ft sword in the name of your oath for vengeance. 
If you're not satisfied with just playing a singular class, you can then sub-class and create absolutely insane builds, my personal favourite being throwzerker (a barbarian that can practically insta-kill most targets by across map throwing OTHER ENEMIES at the targeted enemy)
Alternatively you could just ignore the class system and be a barrelmancer, using explosives of various types to essentially ignite entire battlefields and inconvenience your whole party.
There's legitimately no end to it. If you want to play the game a certain way you probably can, it's absolutely DnD in nature.

The fights can be quite hard at times, but only if you're unprepared or have a poor party dynamic. Sometimes just finding the right gear can shift a whole fight in your favour, even potions I found are incredibly important as some of them can essentially triple your melee damage or let you heal after every kill. The game WANTS you to experiment, go nuts.



TL;DR I could go on for hours about this game, I've barely scratched the surface with this review, but it really is mostly just a letter of love for this game, you won't ever get a good clue of the experience you'll have just from my text. So genuinely try it even if you don't think it's going to be your thing, and better yet, try it with friends.

To see all the different scenario branchings and endings, play several classes, different character alignements, romances, difficulty levels... The content is nothing less than huge. I'm pretty sure another studio would have tried to sell you 4 or 5 DLCs in order to match the amount of content Larian is giving you for the price of one full game. That needs to be pointed out. Also, the replayability potential is great.

Lots of content but more importantly, it's interesting. Not only the core of the scenario, but also your companions personal quests. No stupid quests you will do sighing. BG3 has reached a level of player immersiveness that i only experienced with the Mass Effect games before. It's well written, with just the needed touch of fun from times to times. Voice actors are doing an incredible job and the music sticks with you. The game can feel very different depending on how you choose to play it.

As someone who has never played turn-based or anything D&D-related, here is my review:

I saw this game a year ago and was hesitant to try it due to the turn-based combat and having absolutely no prior experience with D&D. I gave in recently due to wanting a new game to play, and oh boy was I wrong. This is truly a masterpiece; the level of depth in this game is insane. It has completely changed my perspective on this style of game and D&D as a whole.

At first, the abundance of options during character creation truly overwhelmed me, resulting in me spending 6 hours on it alone. But I'm glad it's there because it just makes it that much more replayable. This level of choice continues throughout the game, ensuring your experience is what you want it to be.

Most of these longer story games end up tiring me out, so I just rush through to the end to not feel like I've wasted the time I spent on it already. BG3 is an exception to that; despite being the longest game out of all of them, I truly enjoyed the whole journey.

So when this game first came out and got a lot of attention, I ignored it, thinking it was overrated. Eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to give Baldur's Gate 3 a try. Boy, have I been missing out.

Game play and game mechanics are similar to Dungeons & Dragons. There are nice tie-ins to the series that D&D players (including myself) will appreciate, such as certain races like elves and half-elves having dark vision, critical successes and critical failures, and classes like bards, wizards, and fighters. One key difference between the game and D&D is that in Baldur's Gate 3, instead of rolling initiative at the start of each turn, initiative is rolled only once and remains locked in for the rest of combat. It's not a feature but the most authentic part to D&D are perception checks. Just like D&D your characters will fail almost all of their perception checks. This is true even if they have high wisdom (which affects perception), and even if the switch or button or trap is an inch from their face. Knowledge of D&D isn't required to play though, as there are tutorials for your first play through and game play is intuitive.

Where the game really shines is all of its content. There are so many classes, paladin, barbarian, fighter, druid, cleric, bard, and monk, and just as many races too. Many classes and races also have sub-classes or sub-races, which allows in-depth customization of your characters. The only problem with this is customizing your first character (assuming you don't choose a pre-made one) can take a very long time, especially if you're indecisive like me. My first character Daelis, was a Wild Magic Sorcerer, and I had a cleric, fighter, and rogue in my party. Each class felt distinct and was fun in their own way.

The story was very enjoyable (no spoilers here!). You are forced to make many tough irreversible decisions with far-reaching consequences throughout, this did raise my blood pressure at times but it also made everything feel more consequential. I liked how my party members' backstories diverged and intersected with the main story. Each character was well-written and fully-fleshed out, which made it feel like a real D&D campaign. There isn't much replayability when it comes to the main story. You can make different decisions, which can affect the ending but the overall story line remains the same. Unlike D&D there is only one campaign. Things that surprised you in your first play through will be expected in the second. Replayability is instead found in game play and quests. It's impossible to complete every quest, especially every party member's unique quests, in one play through. All the different races and classes also give the game more replay value. You can also recruit different party members than last time, resulting in new character interactions.

My only complaint is saving in the game. There is an auto-save system, but it only activates after you enter important areas. You're forced to manually quick-save most of the time. I eventually got the hang of it, but it was annoying at first when I forgot to quick-save and lost progress. I played on the Balanced difficulty, which is essentially normal, and struggled during many fights. I had to reload old saves because my party kept dying or failing. That's more of a skill issue on my party than a problem with the game though. If you play a lot of casual games and don't have experience with RPGs, I'd recommend the Narrative or easy mode. Things will still be challenging, it's just your blood pressure won't spike as much.

Overall, this is a good game for anyone who likes D&D or story-rich RPGs with lots of content.",1725472113,1727706679,True,245,7,0.8324752449989318,0,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,positive,100

   In no other single player game in recent history have I invested so many hours into. Started playing it during Early Access, however not on Steam, and due to it have another 125 hours not accounted for here. Usually, no matter how much I enjoy the game, I just play games once (exceptions are games which require multiple playthroughs) and playing anything more than that just gets really tedious and a chore to me. This game managed to bypass that. I am doing several separate playthroughs and having so much fun in every single one because of the sheer amount of varied content it contains as well as all the ways combat can be resolved, you could say only your imagination is the limit. There is just so much to experience.

   I have not played first two Baldur's Gate games, what I had played was Larians' Divinity: Original Sin 2 which saying I enjoyed it is an understatement (still can not get some of the music there out of my head and I might slightly prefer it over music in this game, however incredible it is) and is a main reason why I started the third part. I was not at all disappointed. Game more than delivered and largely expanded on almost everything good DOS 2 did.
You can enjoy this game without having any prior experience with the series. There are characters appearing from previous entries, some even can be your companions. There is some mention of events that transpired, so having prior knowledge is a bonus, but it's nothing major and you will not have missed much otherwise.

   First time I started the game, I just spent a few hours in the character creator, partly due to trying to create a perfect character, partly deciding which class to pick and how I wanted to play and partly just listening to its amazing music. In all this time I still did not get to experience every class, subclass and content hidden behind them. Not only do classes provide different experience concerning combat, they also give you special prompts in dialog (same as races), so for example sorcerer might be all ""I am magic incarnate and you measly creatures cannot contain me!"" while also taking every opportunity to tease wizards; as a paladin people might ask you to judge criminals; as a bard you can just take a break from adventuring, pick your stage and perform music (you can pick it as a feat for other non bard classes, but it will take a while), nearby characters will come nearby and listen to you and even give you gold, it is one of the ways to make gold (however excruciatingly slow one), if your really wanted to you could make your whole party being proficient with instruments and create a band and you can actually hear all the different instruments used by them.

   There is so many routes you can take your character on. On one hand you can be a hero trying to protect innocents, fighting evil, preventing bad guys from their goals, helping everyone as much as possible, not wanting to do anything with mind flayers, while on the other you can be the polar opposite, you can be like the ultimate evil one, you can betray, steal, kill and do things that will leave even the games' evil characters dumbfounded. You can also be anything in between. Game is written so well that no matter the path you take it is fully fledged and makes sense. In most games doing evil things and picking evil choices is just you being rude towards other people and feels really bad picking them, here there is a certain excitement to them, they are more complex and it is like you are experiencing another layer of the game you were not even aware of. 
I think Dark Urge is the best way to play the game if you are mostly interested in the story of the game, resisting it or not, there is so much content connected to it you otherwise miss about the story and so many little bits and pieces that suddenly make sense.

   Game is consisting of three chapters. Each chapter has multiple zones connected to it with a plethora of content. They are all closely interwoven, meaning that saying something while in a dialog to character in chapter one will have consequences with that character in chapter three. Saving someone in chapter one may just see that character in chapter two willing to help you with something you have a need for, or you might just find that character in the last chapter while exploring houses, or suppose you did not save them in chapter one or even killed them, you may just find their relatives in the last chapter wondering what happened to them. Or some of them might help you and make things easier for you. You might just get quests and items you otherwise would not, but you might also miss alternate routes. There is so much content it is impossible to see everything in just one playthrough, or even several.

   Saying that, first and second chapter are as close to perfection as they come while i feel like the last, third chapter of the game is the weakest point of this game. Compared to first two it just feels like it missing something, even though it is filled with content there is a certain emptiness to it. It just feels like it needed a bit more time, for example there is ton of npcs and you can speak with most, however you will just get their one line and that will be the end of it, I understand not every npc could get a full on life story and dialog, but I never felt like this with them in earlier chapters, they are just missing something.
That said, chapter also has many positives, I particularly like how you get a base camp in a rough part of the city, but if you want to pay you can get yourself a whole floor in a tavern and use that as a camp instead. You can rob a bank, help a necromancer (or not), meet zombies (and help them instead), shapeshifters, vampires, obscene cults, even print your own version of towns newspapers with you in it and read them the next day...

In short this is the current greatest game of all time and is more than worth your money I highly recommend buying the deluxe edition simply to support the devs, not to say the additional rewards aren't worth it either, but if that's not enough to convince you go ahead and pirate it. you will come to love the game and want to support the devs anyway.",1730744850,1730744850,True,78,3,0.751775324344635,0,False,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,positive,100

We introduced her best friend to this game, he now has more hours than I do. 

I introduced *my* best friend to this game, he has passed me in the story.

They'll be thinking about Faerun.

 [h2] My experience [/h2] 
With 238 hours under my belt, I've become completely entangled in its storytelling, stunning visuals, and characters.

I'm new to Dungeons & Dragons, so the first hours of playing were more than confusing and complex for me, haha. My main motive to play this game was the fact that your choices in this game have consequences - much like [i] Detroit: Become Human, Life is Strange [/i]  , and so on....
I'm a big fan of this concept... so I bought it! ( [b] if only I knew that this game has so much more to offer ♥ [/b])

 [h2] Visuals and Characters [/h2] 
 [b]Visuals[/b]: Visually, the game is a work of art, with many interactive details. (to the point where even in the fith run you will still find something new.)
 [b]Characters[/b]: They're living, breathing beings with their own hopes, fears, and ambitions (and most importantly- backstories). The fact that you can romanc them is definetly... interesting!
Though I've tried romancing different characters in each playthrough, there's something about Astarion's charm that keeps drawing me back, much to my own surprise. As a self-proclaimed vampire connoisseur, I find myself irresistibly drawn to his allure every single time. ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚

That's the game's magic, and that's also why I'm not even going to attempt to do a long, detailed review of the game. I'm not someone who necessarily vibes with the combat in [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]- I prefer things to be faster pace, and a bit more forgiving to the occasional incorrect input. However, that's not stopping me from being extremely positive on [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]. The main reason why I love it so much, and probably the best thing I can say about it, is that it respects your time and decisions more than any game I've ever played. Companies like Telltale blew up by creating games that give you the illusion of choice; you pick between option 1 and option 2, but the ultimate outcome is essentially the same regardless of your choice. [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] doesn't do crap like that. You will make decisions 2 hours into this game, that will impact quests and stories 50 hours into the game. Your decisions will impact who lives, who dies, who you're allied with, etc. This expands out on such a scale that there isn't 1 or 2 different outcomes, there are hundreds, probably thousands of different outcomes to thousands of different scenarios. If you and 24 of your friends all play this campaign, you'll all have wildly different experiences across the entire game; that's not something you can say about other games that have sold themselves on ""player choice/agency"". This same respect translates to exploring the world; you're rewarded with unique weapons, spells, character interactions, etc. The respect Larian has for your choices and exploration, combined with the brilliant characters and voice acing make [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] an unforgettable experience that is extremely replayable.

Modding community is already off to a great start giving this game potential longevity for many years to come.

Only downside I can think of is that it can be a learning curve for anyone not familiar with 5E rulesets, or world interactivity mechanics the game engine provides.  Stealth mechanics can be a tad janky and unattractive at the surface level until the player takes time to learn/understand them - although its usage is still fairly consistent and rewarding.

I found the game to be worth it as a huge RPG fan, but a more casual fan of the genre wouldn't be in the wrong to wait for a sale.

[h1]Graphics & Sound: 10/10[/h1]

✔️ Excellent narrative depth, with a huge amount of player agency.
✔️ Varied and intriguing companions with a big deal of character growth.
✔️ A very rich world to explore, with little to no filler content - every character has a story, every locale has something of value to find.
✔️ Despite the pretty poor D&D game system, Larian managed to allow for a pretty huge amount of build options by creating a lot of unique magical items with build-defining effects.
✔️ Seamless multiplayer gameplay.
✔️ Extremely clean turn-based tactical combat implementation, with a lot of environment interactions.
✔️ Nice character customisation options.

💭 The game suffers a lot from being based on D&D ruleset - while the developers did a lot to try and erase the flaws of the system, it can't evade those entirely. You have to deal with a rest system that is difficult to integrate in a natural game flow, the hit/miss mechanics that can make you play entire turns with no result, and a progression system that makes you choose between straight up improving your character or getting access to minor fun options. None of those make the game bad, but it makes you wonder how good the game would have been if it wasn't tainted by D&D.
💭 Narratively it also suffers from being set in Forgotten Realms due to how much the worldbuilding relies on there being ""evil"" races to justify having default antagonists the player won't feel bad about killing. The game tries to timidly tackle the subject a few times, but all the goblins you see are still evil raiders, and it is never questioned.

❌ There is one major dissonance between what the narration conveys and what is expected from the player - the game sets up a huge feeling of urgency right from the start, pushing the player to hurry up and take as few breaks as possible, while a lot of the game's events actually need long rests to occur, and there are no downsides to resting (apart from possibly running out of resources, but that isn't really a factor either, you find a lot of food). Just know that there is no hurry, and you need to rest quite often to not miss interesting narrative content.

Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 manages the feat of being a wonderful game despite being based on a mediocre game system and being set in a mediocre fantasy setting - you actually feel the amount of effort it took to swim against the current here and produce something so good in the end. It makes me even more optimistic about the next game by Larian Studios - if I could get any more optimistic after Divinity Original Sin 2.",1726058657,1726058657,True,19,1,0.6487687826156616,1,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,positive,100

I like games that:
1) reward clever and careful combat while punishing mistakes and lack of preparation
2) reward exploration, observation, memory, and creativity (If you need, or feel like you should have taken notes, this is a good sign of a mature and rich game)
3) allow a variety of play styles, moral alignment, and offer significant role playing opportunities, all of which culminate in different paths through the game and different outcomes for the world and the player-character.

Both Larian and FromSoft understand that a combination of many very well executed aspects of game design contribute to an experience that is more than the sum of its parts. There is some sort of emergent magic that happens when such care and thought is put into the initial design, even when some aspects of the finished product leave something to be desired.

Gameplay is excellent. Combat is clear and precise. It rewards preparation, creative approaches, and punishes sloppy play. Resource management is crucial. Combat is extremely accessible, as it does not rely on reaction times, mechanical skill, or extreme practice. Anyone who can observe, think, and operate a mouse can play this game well and have fun with it, without intrusive or demeaning accessibility options. The inclusion of a difficulty slider actually works well in this game. Difficulty sliders often ruin the experience, as they merely introduce absurd artificial difficulty or handicaps. Skyrim is a perfect example of this, as Legendary difficulty doesn't make the game harder, it just makes it more annoying and more time consuming. BG3's difficulty slider alters the AI, their perception, and their tactics, in addition to balanced and fair adjustments to hitpoints and damage output. There is also an honest player's hidden difficulty adjustment: the frequency of saves and reloads. The game can be MUCH easier or INFINITELY harder based on how often saves are made.

The world of BG3 is so incredibly rich and enthralling that it feels endless and bottomless. At the time of writing this review, I binged my first playthrough and cut significant corners towards the end, creating a backup save at a certain point of no return to experience a different ending and tie up some major loose ends. I would estimate that a completionist playthrough would take well over 100 hours. A quick playthrough of the game would likely be 30-40 hours, and would be difficult to achieve on a first playthrough without missing significant content. I do appreciate that Larian is willing to allow the player to miss significant content. They are leaving 'excess value on the table', which is the real mark of a generous and passionate developer.

My first playthrough was a Dark Urge background character, where the character is overwhelmed by murderous impulses and crippled by amnesia. The number of different outcomes in this character background alone is absurd. The number of alterations to quests based on my class alone is absurd. The number of different game-altering choices that I was allowed to make, both to hinder and help me, throughout the game was absolutely insane. TRULY, no two playthroughs will be alike. The only way that one could have an identical playthrough is if a save were duplicated.

I have only a few small nitpicks: 
1) The UI leaves something to be desired, particularly the inventory. I wish ""pockets"" had been implemented, where various items would automatically sort themselves into user-defined categories. I often find my inventory filled with scrolls and arrows, with pieces of armor, story items, and interesting trinkets mixed in. The camp/global storage is a wasteland of collected junk, one-time-use special items, wares to be sold, books, and lore pieces.
2) I find that alchemy is a bit under-utilized. I wish a more general guidebook, perhaps with species and farm locations, could be filled as the player progressed through the game. A small rework could significantly improve this. I love the inclusion of the system, but as only 20% of players have created 3 or more potions, it does need some attention.
3) Quest pathfinding could use a bit of attention... Often when entering/leaving a building, the quest marker will direct the player back in the direction they just came from. One particular quest towards the end of the game required me to look up the location of a certain... maligned NPC atop his Rock.
4) A turn-jump mechanic would be useful when many enemies are in combat, such as during a particular encephalitic encounter. This would be especially helpful when allies or enemies are separated by great distances or other area barriers.

Larian is now another developer that gives me hope for the future of the industry. No microtransactions, no subscriptions, no BS. Just a pure, passionate, and rich game that kept me engaged for my entire playthrough, and will provide many more hours of fun on subsequent playthroughs.",1709012475,1709013376,True,7,0,0.6202531456947326,0,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,positive,100

So when I started playing this game in full release, I already knew it was going to be pretty good. But the full release was far better than my own expectations. This already is most likely one of my favourite games and I have yet to explore other possibilities ingame. 

The finale of every act feels so rewarding after all your efforts. The details in every zone are amazing, i found myself exploring every single room and corner of the world and collecting books, notes and other papers full of lore. 

My favourite Act was definitely Act III but not to say Act I and II were bad. It was because of the previous Acts that Act III made sense and felt so satisfying. 

My favourite arc (if you can call it that) was House of Hope or Raphael's arc. I'm sure most of the players agree they enjoyed his song during his ""boss fight"". This poetic devil named Raphael is one my favourite characters. I think he and Mizora truly represent what we know of devils. (Nice detail on 666HP). Hope was also cool, wholesome and funny. How am I not gonna save her during my evil run...

My favourite companion is predictable I know, but yes Shadowheart and I am not talking about romance (only). Every character really developed during the story and trying to solve their own personal problems while fighting together to solve their common problem, the illithid tadpoles stuck in their brains and saving the world from the Absolute (or not depending on your choices). Most characters (even NPCs) have a story, a personality, a opinion of their own, So sometimes, if you are making certain decisions, you might not just be affecting the main or secondary characters but also a ""random"" NPC walking by.

Cinematics were amazing and well planned. I used screenshot a lot!
I hope the voice actors of this game were payed good. The characters felt so real with their emotions and personalities. The team who worked on expressions and body language helped a lot to give the characters life of course.

A few extras I feel the need to say:
Shadow isles was the hardest part imo. It did indeed felt how hard it was to live in those conditions and the amount of destruction in the various places of the map caused by the curse. But again all that to satisfyingly reward us with a lot.
Karlach's ending made me want to cry no matter the ending you chose (cry from sadness, relief or joy)
I'm not sure if I missed stuff in the previous Acts, but Act III felt the longest one. It was probably intended.

I think thats all? Thanks for reading and for the patience!

[h2] Roleplaying Elements [/h2]
Many great games put you in the driver’s seat without relying on the illusion of control, but Baldur’s Gate 3 has managed to surprise me in this regard. Almost every action you take has consequences, and sometimes the order of your actions determines the future. This greatly enhances replayability. The game rewards thoughtful decisions and truly allows for role-playing—a term sadly misused in many modern games.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
The overall gameplay is incredibly rewarding, as you constantly see the outcomes of your actions, both in and out of combat. The build variety adds tons of fun, offering endless experimentation and enhancing replayability.

[h2] Voice acting and dialogue [/h2]
Simply marvelous. Every single voice actor did an amazing job, and their passion is evident in every line. The dialogue flows effortlessly, thanks to exceptional writing.

[h2] Story and characters [/h2]
While the dialogue shines, the story is one of the weaker aspects of Baldur’s Gate 3. Though somewhat clichéd, it doesn’t detract from the game’s overall quality. The diverse and compelling cast of characters, combined with deep role-playing mechanics, makes the story engaging and worthwhile.

[h2] Sound & Music [/h2]
The soundtrack is unforgettable. Hearing “Down by the River” during character creation and “Song of Balduran” in Act 3 are moments I’ll cherish forever. Returning to camp after a hard-fought battle, chatting with companions while listening to these fantastic songs—that’s something truly special.

[h2] UI/UX [/h2]
The UI is concise, easy to understand, and navigate—an essential feature for a game of this complexity.

[h2] CO-OP experience [/h2]
We played the game in 2-player co-op, and it was easily the best multiplayer experience I’ve ever had. The interactions were smooth, with no “host-guest complications” like in many other games. Debating dialogue options, deciding who to side with, and plotting betrayals made for a truly memorable experience.

[h2] Bugs [/h2]
As with any game of this scale, there are bugs. Acts 1 and 2 were nearly flawless, but Act 3 had some issues, such as cutscenes not loading, enemies failing to act, and visual inconsistencies. While not game-breaking, these bugs were slightly annoying and worth mentioning.

But what I was (and still am!) is an avid TTRPG player, and a D&D player. All 900+ hours of Critical Role? Yup. Dimension20? Also yes. I love the collaborative nature of games, of exploring what is possible, and the telling of a good story. I had hear a little about this Baldur's Gate game coming out from friends who played EA, seen some clips online, and then on release, I saw it everywhere. There's a big cross-over between BG3 fans and D&D fans, surprising no one. I didn't have a gaming console that could play it (see above: the Switch), nor a laptop good enough (my laptop could barely handle three open windows at a time), and I assumed this would be a game I couldn't play for a while. I was curious about it, as I heard it replicated D&D mechanics well and that combat was turn-based. One of the things that I have been intimidated by other games (I've tried Skyrim and BOTW, and let me tell you I'm not great at real-time combat) seemed like it would not be a problem here. My curiosity was well and truly caught.

Then comes me stumbling across a Reddit post about if you could play it, and finding the GeForce Now service. I figured I would sign up to a lower tier, get the game, see if my laptop and internet could handle it, and go from there.

Well. That was back in September 2023. It is now February 2024. I have over 400 hours, two completed campaigns, and well on the way to finishing a third, and I now own a gaming pc capable of playing it without GeForce Now. To say it change my life and opened up a whole host of experience, really doesn't do it justice.

BG3 is not only incredibly gorgeous in the graphics, it is full of heart and story in a way that took me by surprise. The countless solutions that are available to the presented problems blows me away (seriously, I would love to peak behind the covers of what those planning meetings were like!), how creativity is constantly rewarded by unique and fun dialogues. I'm still finding 'new' things on every play through, still talking to friends old and new about different ways we've approached problems, and I still am so engaged. Not only that, the writing and acting of every companion, tav, and npc in this game is incredible. I've learned about their stories, felt their successes, cried with the ending of character arcs as if they were my own. I have been faced with choices that made me reconsider everything I knew about the game, made me examine my own reactions when playing through the lens of another character.

Yes, it has turn-based combat and that is absolutely a feature and a highlight of the experience. There is an incredible amount of choices across class, background, and race that lets you craft a character to your liking, and then rewards you for playing into that character. There's loot, and meta jokes, and moments that show you a team of incredibly dedicated humans put so much care and love into crafting the best came they could. The feeling of capturing a real D&D game and putting on the screen is hard, and I think the team did a fantastic job at realising that experience.

This game also got me through some incredibly tough moments at the end of 2023. It's escapism and joy and I cannot thank the stars that aligned to bring it across my path. The community that has grown around it in online spaces is a delight and brought connection at times when I needed it.

Every ounce of this game pours out with love from its creators and the amount of dialogue specific class/character prompts is truly mind boggling. It is not, however, a flawless game, if this game were released before the days of games coming out half baked I would say this would have been an above average buggy experience. By today's standards it is fine as it is a functional and fully fleshed out finished game. Understandably there is also a lot of deep game mechanics at play here and although I'm not a game designer, I can appreciate how these would lend themselves to more bugs. As the systems struggle to play nice with each other while offering you as much freedom to play how you want. After all creating DnD in video game form is no easy feat and this has by far accomplished it more than any other in my mind. I would say in every game session I had I encountered bugs but most of these are not of note and are just graphical issues. At the most I would lose an hour and a half which would be frustrating but not enough to deter me from continuing and usually it is a combat encounter being repeated. That being said I only lost that amount of time twice so most bugs are lot more minute in comparison. As you learn the game mechanics and systems you also learn how to play around most of these issues and thus the later I went into the game the less amount of time I lost to silly things. I put 200 hours into a single play through and was impressed and blown away through all of it. There is just so much to appreciate in this game, so much to revisit and things to be excited about on further play-throughs. It may not be a perfect game but in my mind it is one of the best.

I love many games, but this is one of the only real 10/10 I can give. I think the words and label ""10/10"" and ""masterpiece"" are used too often. This is one that really deserves it.

From the very beginning, the game captures your attention with its stunning visuals, engaging storytelling, and intricate character development. Larian Studios has truly outdone themselves in creating an experience that pays homage to the beloved Baldur's Gate series while introducing fresh and innovative gameplay mechanics.

The first two acts of the game are nothing short of brilliant. The attention to detail in the environments, the diverse array of characters, and the complex narrative choices make for a truly unforgettable experience. The combat system is both strategic and dynamic, offering a perfect blend of classic RPG elements and modern gameplay.

The character creation and progression system in Baldur's Gate 3 are exceptional, allowing players to mold their characters into unique personalities with their own strengths, weaknesses, and backstories. The companions you encounter throughout your journey are well-written and add depth to the overall narrative, with each having their own quirks and motivations.

However, where Baldur's Gate 3 falters is in its final act. The journey to the climax is nothing short of spectacular, but as the story reaches its pinnacle, the experience becomes marred by a noticeable lack of polish. Quests become less refined, and the overall level of detail in both the narrative and the environment seems to take a hit.

While the final act still manages to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the overarching story, the lack of polish is undeniable. Some plotlines feel rushed, and there are instances where the game's performance dips, breaking the otherwise immersive experience. It's disappointing to see such a fantastic journey conclude with a slightly tarnished finale.

Despite these shortcomings, Baldur's Gate 3 remains a must-play for any RPG enthusiast. The majority of the game is a testament to Larian Studios' dedication to quality, and the final act, although unpolished, doesn't diminish the overall enjoyment of the game. With the promise of updates and improvements, there's hope that the developers will address these issues, ensuring that Baldur's Gate 3 stands as a shining example of modern RPG excellence.",1705867532,1705867532,True,6,1,0.5931952595710754,4,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,positive,100

This was an experience. I don't usually write reviews for games, even my favorite ones, but I write reviews for books, and this game felt like a book to me.

[h3]The Good[/h3]

First, I want to say how incredibly developed most of the story is, particularly the lifelike portrayal of the characters. The voice acting sets a new standard, arguably the best across all games, given the extensive voice work throughout. Even minor characters are voiced with excellence. The gameplay was something completely new to me, as I've never played DnD nor any game of this playstyle before. I was weirded out by the combat at the start, but as time passed and I managed to kill a formidable boss by distracting it with a cat. Needless to say, I fell in love with the combat. This game offers unparalleled freedom, allowing players to explore various paths, each with its own beauty. Also, story-wise, so many characters say some genuinely profound quotes that left me pondering for hours. LOTR is probably my favorite movie series, and fantasy books are my favorite genre to read; this game provided me with that immersion while giving me the choice to shape the story in almost any direction I wanted. Playing through the Creche during Act 1, accompanied by the music of Mountain Pass, felt like experiencing Fellowship of The Ring in game form.

The music, in particular, deserves commendation—it stands among the best I've encountered across all forms of media, not just in video games. I was flabbergasted to learn that most of the ambient tracks haven't even been officially released. Kudos to Borislav Slavov for the incredible soundtrack; I'll always remember him and what he made me feel with his music.

Acts 1 & 2 are nearly flawless. Act 1 was polished to impossible magnitudes; every side quest was lovable, every location was there for a solid reason, every enemy, every character, especially the Creche and Underdark parts. I haven't felt so excited for a game as I was during playing Act 1 since forever. Then, Act 2 surpassed it for me and became my favorite. I was drawn to its eerie, mysterious, and dark ambiance, which constantly reminded me that I didn't belong there. Amidst the darkness, stumbling upon a brightly lit inn, where goodness prevailed against all odds, the last frontier of humanity, it left a lasting, hopeful impact. Lastly, The villain of Act 2 was built up for 60 hours and delivered every single ounce of it.

[b][i]""I have a price to pay for my power; it will cost me your life…for my own, I have already paid.""[/i][/b]

[h3]The Bad[/h3]

Throughout the first half of the game, I was astonished and was sure this is the most perfect game ever made, but it really does have its issues. The issues showed in Act 3. It felt like an entirely different game, marred by performance issues and a rushed, unpolished plot. Certain plotlines, including that of the guardian, felt forced, inserted merely for the sake of a twist. The pacing felt off, and the quests lacked coherence. The world is in imminent danger of being completely destroyed, but meanwhile, you can halt all of that and go exorcise a possessed individual, searching for clues around the city. Why not, I guess?

[h3]The Ugly[/h3]

Bugs became noticeable towards the end of Act 2, and by Act 3, they rendered the game almost unplayable at times. I found myself restarting frequently during Act 3. Not only were there strange battles where waiting for turns dragged on for 5 minutes, but they were also plagued with bugs. I refrained from using many spells, including summons, due to their buggy and game-breaking nature. Even pets were affected. The ultimate disappointment came during the final fight, which I had hoped would be more polished. Instead, it was riddled with switcheroo bugs that made watching the fights impossible. It was an absolutely dreadful experience.

Another frustrating issue was the romance aspect. Like, I want to hug Gale, as a friend, or Wyll, I do not want to have sex with them. Not everyone I hug is someone I want to be intimate with, nor does showing kindness to someone necessarily indicate romantic feelings. The whole dynamic felt forced, leading me to make decisions I otherwise wouldn't have made just to avoid unintentionally initiating a romance.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3] 

This game is truly remarkable, perhaps one of the best ever created. It had the potential to be even greater, I believe, if the final act received the same level of care, attention to detail, and polish as Acts 1 and 2. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, it remains an incredible experience. It's certain to hold a place in my top 5 games of all time. I'd rate it a solid 9/10. As for its shortcomings, maybe they get tackled with a definitive edition in the future, and it will become a 10/10? Well, hopefully.

The game is amazing and has set a new standard for AAA games, the world is carefully crafted, Its feels lived in, its relaxing and soothing in a weird way. The only other game that made me feel this way when walking around it was probably Kingdom come: Deliverance just because of how realistic it feels, Realistic in a sense that it feels like you could very well see something similar in real life, people going about their day, working their jobs, doing their routines, I feel like that's that something that is rarely captured and done well in RPG's or is something that is simply overlooked and barely given any attention to by the developers.

The voice actors and actresses also did an amazing job as well as the writing team, each character was incredibly interesting thanks to them. None of the main characters are boring carbon copies of each other, they all have their own personalities, mannerisms, they all have deep stories that you end up uncovering more and more as you progress through the game making them feel even more fleshed with each part of the game, and the voice actors and actresses did an amazing job translating all of that into their voices. 

The writing is outstanding for both the NPC's and the Playable characters, The writing got me immersed in my characters to the point when I was picking dialogue I wasn't looking for the option with the best outcome but what MY character would say, whereas in other games like Skyrim, Kingdom come or fallout I would often do the opposite. The character creator is also really good, every time I created a new character for a different play through I would always end up building lore of that character in my head, I never wanted to just make a character that just looks cool, I also wanted them to have a story prior to the events of the game.

If you don't know whether you should buy the game or not because you might not end up liking, trust me, give it a go. You have two hours of playtime to refund the game if you don't end up liking it, or you can get the game through other means although I urge you to buy it if you're interested in it and have the money to do so. I have never played a game in this genre prior to Baldurs gate 3, My main interest in games were competitive multiplayer games such as counter strike, rainbow six siege, call of duty and I have the hours to back it up on my profile, *2800 hours on counter strike, 1800 hours on R6 siege.* I ended up loving it and it caused me and my friends to gain massive interest in DnD to the point where we're planning on setting up a campaign at some point. 

Baldurs gate 3 has set a new standard for games, I think it's unfair to expect indie games to be held to the same standard as Baldurs gate 3. But AAA games SHOULD be and NEED to be held to the standard of Baldurs gate 3, it's ridiculous that these massive studios are releasing broken half completed games for full price, some of them having gold or special editions which cost even more and rarely add anything of value to the game, not to mention how many times the studios attack or ridicule people when they go to point the obvious flaws a game has or even when providing constructive criticism.

Mostly polish was a bit of a problem with minor annoying bugs randomly popping up; often dialogue with a certain NPC would not progress the quest properly if a battle ends without my character being close enough to them. Another was that an NPC merchant would no longer sell some useful equipment because I progressed a quest that took place in the building.
Rarely, a quest kinda fails if you long rest after starting it... but it doesn't mark the quest in your journal. This happened in Act 1 and 2, and I had to reload after I realised that some NPCs died when they could have been saved.
There were also a few dialogue bugs where some dialogue skips or doesn't progress without pressing the skip button.
Everything else, I loved. The gameplay was as good as it could have been, though I think Divinity OS 2's gameplay was slightly better suited for a video game than the 5e D&D rules. The dialogue and voice acting were superb, and the facial animations were excellent. Virtually every NPC get a little personality, even if they only have a single line. And there are a lot of NPCs.
The characters were incredible and when I finished the game, I felt genuinely sad that my journey was over. It reminds of the ending I got for BG2, in which I had similarly bittersweet feelings after finishing it.

I played it the first time on a console and after first 1o hours I rage-quit because it was so hyped at the time, I was overly judgemental about everything and I was MAD. Expectations management failed.
I have a tendency to rush through the story in games which you don't want to do here AT ALL otherwise it's a really disappointing experience. 

I came back a week later to give it another go because I'm greedy, deluxe edition for ps5 costed quite a lot. And also curious to know what the hype was actually about.
I did my first playthrough and still was not really impressed, especially by the ending.

What I did like though was music (huge kudos to Borislav Slavov, the music is just magical) and the visuals. The game is such an eye candy! This aspect is important because it pushed me to try the game again but on PC so I can use custom camera tool to take nice pictures.

And here's where the love story begins.

I'm enjoying the game now because I know how I should play it and I'm more or less used to turned-based combat by now. Must admit, not a huge fan of turned-based combat, but it's DnD, it's only right. 

Larian Studios did a great job and they continue to provide us with improvements. New kisses animations are amazing, this is something I didn't have the first time and was a bit disappointed by how bland the romances were with just one animation. And it's just one example. There are many more.

With the rise of Ubisoft ""open world"" slop and microtransactions, actually good AAA games are few and far between nowadays and I'm so glad BG3 turned out the way it did.

The main quirk of BG3's gameplay is that it's based on the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game, meaning the combat system is turn based and heavily reliant on dice rolls. To increase your chances of winning encounters, you actually have to think, maybe even read some tutorial messages and tooltips, not just hold W and left-click. 90% of the negative reviews on games with turn based combat systems are always a bit sad to read because they always boil down to: ""Game is bad cuz I can't read."" and it is a shame because they massively overshadow the constructive criticism of the remaining 10%.

What I'm trying to say is that unless your attention span has been cooked by TikTok, you're going to be absolutely fine as Larian did a fantastic job with the ""Examine"" and ""Inspect"" features and if they aren't digestible enough for you, there are thousands of guides and introduction videos to the complex world of Baldur's Gate and DnD.

It's hard to praise raw graphical prowess of a modern videogame as the gaming industry has already met something of a barrier in this department. However I can absolutely give praise to the amazing art direction. From the fire and brimstone of Bhaal's Temple to the peaceful wildlife of the Druid Grove, every single environment and location feels unique, believable and looks absolutely stunning.

It's an unfortunate fact that there are no perfect games and Baldur's Gate 3 is no exception. While the main story is pretty engaging at first, it becomes painfully obvious how shallow the main three villains are by the time you get to the last act. Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible per se but they fail to be anything asides from being the obvious bad guy that needs to be defeated in order to move the story forward. Ketheric Thorm especially had a ton of potential. Judging from his character design and backstory, I suspect there were plans for him to be more nuanced than his final version.

This is especially puzzling to me because the optional side storylines are absolutely amazing with their deep and impactful choices you can make in them.

Less significant issues include:

- Sub-optimal inventory system
- The camera sometimes getting stuck in environment where a lot of verticality is involved
- Minor texture pop-in in areas with a lot of NPCs
- Critical failures in dialogue skill checks invalidating any buffs you have
- The need to savescum an encounter in Act 2 involving Isobel because failure causes you to get locked out of 75% of the content in said Act
- The absence of an option to pause cutscenes
- Alert being too necessary of a feat, limiting creativity with your builds
- Certain characters being way too horny after being exposed to basic human decency, I guess it's realistic if nothing else
- The Long/Short rest system sometimes grinding gameplay to a hault because you ran out of spell slots just before a boss fight
- Some rare and miscellaneous bugs

Overall, it's an exceptional game despite its minor shortcomings and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something different than the typical modern AAA stuff.

I didn't really see the point as this game completely deserves its Overwhelmingly Positive status, but I'll just speak from the heart, here. I played Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 back in the day, as a young person diving into the classics and wanting to see where Dragon Age: Origins got its soul from. So the idea of Baldur's Gate 3 ever even being made -- let alone in next-gen graphics, with full voice acting, endless reactivity, and from a passionate studio of developers who put their blood, sweat, and tears into bringing the D&D 5e universe alive into a video game -- seemed absurd. Surely that would be too much of an undertaking? Would it even profit?

But here we are. And the game is real. And it's a beautiful outlier, an impossible passion project - from the fans, to the actors, to the developers - that will stay us with for a long, long time - just like its predecessors.

If you're new to Baldur's Gate: play the game. Go in blind. Fall under its spell.
If you're a veteran of the series: The third act is when this game reminds you that it is [b]Baldur's Gate.[/b] Don't be surprised if you want to go right back to BG2 after this out of nostalgia.

Turns out, I never truly understood and appreciated the ""role playing"" part of ""role playing game"" prior to playing BG3.  Any future RPG I ever play going forward will be held against BG3 as a standard.

The sheer amount of customization and open world exploration available int his game has completely redefined the genre.  There are no less than 10 full playthroughs possible with this game with countless choices and consequences in a decision tree that is pretty incalculable for most mere mortals.  You may have seen memes of this game, but you can choose your entire experience.  You can be a degenerate, or you can be wholesome; you can choose predefined characters with predefined story archs, or you can invent your own.

If you like RPGs, tactics, huge adventures and bears, the game is a must-buy. It's not a question. The only real question is: Are you into turn-based combat, tough choices, intrigues, ready to spend at least 100 hours+ into the game?

GAMEPLAY

It's an isometric RPG, very well executed. Combat is turn based, very similiar to Divinity Original Sin. You can exploit almost any fight as much as you want, throw hundreds of barrels upon your enemies just before setting them on fire. It's as bad as great in my opinion. I've talked to multiple bosses just to reload my save, setup a perfect ambush and just obliterate them without any dialogue. Seems weird. Boss too tough? Surround him with explosive barrels before a fight and blow his ass off,

Larian did something great combining classical RPGs and their own style. You have your ordinary RPG: classes, abilities, XP, lockpicking, multiclasses. Then you have a simulated world that you can interact with in creative way. Can't pick a chest? Just take it away to open in camp or just smash the lock instead of lockpicking it. 

EXPLORATION

I got bored of generic RPG games, which didn't reward a player for being curious. Be curious here. Go here, there and there and you'll be rewarded. Either be it with an item or even a quest. It definitely delivers the exploration aspect. It is dense and even emptier areas are packed with surprises. Characters, chests, secrets, stories, scrolls, books (READ THEM, they give lots of information and lore).

STORY

It's mostly great, but it kinda doesn't deliver at the end aswell. You've got a lot of choices to make, paths to decide, yet they get narrower the more the story progresses. It's hit and miss. Don't get me wrong, the acting, characters and story is still phenomenal, just uneven in my opinion.
Some core characters miss a lot of opportunity to be even deeper, it just ends so quick with either black or white. The deeper we go, the shallower waters we encounter.

Companions are on a completely different level. You've got so many unique, talented, charismatic characters in this game, it blows my mind. To be fair their stories got me more engaged than the main story. Even though some of them left me immediately after some of my choices, I'm still eager to let another playthrough a go, just to see their stories and reactions.

SOUNDTRACK

Cannot to mention the phenomenal OST. It's great at least said. Some songs are just... another level. You don't or won't forget them, flashbacks from the fights and exploration will comeback. Borislav Slavov did climb up to his top! Even after beating the game, I still keep coming back to those great memories.

Naturally, I was excited to dive into Path of Exile 2, and after investing over 300 hours, I initially enjoyed the game as well. Unfortunately, my perspective shifted drastically after just one day.

Here’s what happened:

When I logged into my main character (Infernalist), which I had painstakingly leveled to 94 and invested most of my playtime in, I discovered my account had been hacked. Nearly all of my valuable gear and items were stolen. I immediately reported the issue to support via email and forums, hoping for swift action.

While investigating, I managed to track down the hacker myself by searching for my missing items in the trade market. They were openly selling my entire setup. I provided this information to support and even posted about it on the forums, asking the moderators to block the hacker from selling the stolen items.

To my shock, my forum posts were removed, and I was put on probation for requesting action against the hacker. Not only was I robbed of the time and effort I’d invested in the game, but I also felt silenced by the very team I turned to for help.

The email response from support was even more frustrating. After receiving a generic, copy-paste reply, my account was locked—effectively punishing me for being the victim of a hack. As I browsed the forums, I found that many other players had experienced similar situations: accounts compromised, reports filed, and then locked out by support.

This entire experience has been deeply disappointing. It feels like being kicked while already down. Instead of offering meaningful support, GGG’s response added insult to injury.

Until there’s a significant change in how these situations are handled, I cannot recommend Path of Exile 2 in its current state.

Edit:
I am still locked out of my account, with no response from support despite multiple follow-ups. To make matters worse, players on the forums are reporting being locked out for weeks without any resolution or updates. This lack of communication only adds to the frustration and leaves me questioning GGG’s commitment to resolving such critical issues.

Edit2:
It’s the start of a new year, and I’m still locked out of my account with no response from support. The wait continues.

Edit3:
For those seeking more details about similar account-related issues, I recommend checking the ""Help and Information"" section on GGG's Path of Exile forum. Many players are sharing their experiences there, which might provide additional context regarding the current situation.

Edit4:
My account has been locked since December 27, 2024, and I have not received any response from support. The situation surrounding account breaches remains as unclear as ever. Numerous players, including myself, have reported taking extensive security precautions, yet accounts are still being compromised without any evident cause or pattern.

Efforts to get information about the account recovery process, including inquiries made by locked-out players on the forum, have provided no clear details or timelines. Meanwhile, the number of compromised accounts seems to be increasing daily, a situation that can be followed on the forums, further adding to the growing frustration and concern among the community.

It’s particularly disheartening to note that the hacker I identified—who had taken my gear and items—still has access to the game and appears to be actively trading an even wider range of gear and items.

Until these issues are resolved, it might be safer to avoid engaging with the game to protect your account. I do not place blame on GGG, but the growing reports of account compromises and the lack of understanding about how they occur are deeply unsettling.

I've forced myself to go through most of the endgame, pushed to t15 maps, got lvl 90, 8 ascendacy points etc.

While there are moments of greatness, significant flaws hold the game back from being truly enjoyable in the long run. 

Pros:

Animations are fluid and visually impressive, adding a sense of polish to combat and abilities. Same with effects and graphics in general—the world of the game is visually appealing, with a great atmosphere that does it job to immerse players into the dark fantasy world of POE.

The 3-Act campaign is well-crafted, enjoyable, and easily the most rewarding part of the game.

Cons:

Endgame Balance: The endgame feels tedious, plagued by poor drop rates, frustrating atlas mechanics, and build limitations. Progression feels more like a chore than a reward. Tldr: You might end up crippling your experience and getting frustrated faster than you may get your 5 socket gem or find your first divine orb :)

On-Death Effects: These mechanics are far too punishing and unfun, making the game feel unfair rather than challenging.

RNG Dependency (in a bad way): The trials (Sekhemas and Chaos) are overly punishing. The mechanics lack inspiration and offer little room for meaningful counterplay. The RNG itself is too punishing—if you get unlucky with debuffs, you can outright lose the trial through no fault of your own. For example, getting a movement speed debuff often leaves you as good as screwed, no matter how well you’ve prepared. I think it can be easily improved by adding more links between room choices in Sekhemas and more debuff choices in Chaos and making debuffs less punishing at least in early stages.

Similarly, the Atlas system feels like a battle against RNG rather than a test of skill or preparation, punishing players regardless of their gear or build. The endgame allows little to no creativity in build crafting. The game is so punishing that players are forced to build around strict defensive caps just to survive. For example, you have to push resistances, but even then, you can still be one-shot by an absurd ""on death"" mechanic from a random white mob. Survivability becomes mandatory, leaving players no choice but to roll defenses on every single piece of gear. The game is just unplayable otherwise.

*Kripparian’s video ""Path of Exile 2 is Ruthless"" captures these issues perfectly. The endgame systems feel needlessly harsh and punishing.

Final Thoughts (updated):

I can recommend Path of Exile 2 in its current state solely for its excellent 3-act campaign, which is a fantastic experience.

However, I suggest avoiding the game’s endgame content for now, as it is plagued by poor balance, frustrating RNG mechanics, and punishing systems that stifle build creativity.
If you’re interested in the good endgame experience, I recommend waiting until GGG hopefully addresses at leat some of the abovementioned issues, fixes the endgame, adds more classes, updates the skill tree, fixes armor/resistance balance and so on.

The game is graphically stunning, the sound design and music are top notch and the performance is great.

However, I am happy this is an Early Access, as the game has some issues that need to be addressed:

1. The concept of using your currency during the campaign to make your items better is perfect, but to do so you need the aformentioned currency, which barely drops. There is no deterministic crafting during the campaign, so you pick up an item, make it magic, if it's a good mod you upgrade it, and you continue this cycle for a few times until you have the item you want. There is no guaranteed way of getting upgrades, Path of Exile had this and it made the campaign quite a lot better.

2. The reason why the currency drop rate is lowered is because of the new loot system, supposedly dropping more useful items at the cost of not having entire screens of loot. Again, this is perfect in a vacuum, but the items you can use are rare, I've gotten halfway through Act 2 and I am still using mostly Act 1 items.

3. The new gem system is intuitive and takes away a lot of the frustration that was present in the old system. What is not fine is dropping 25 Uncut Skill Gems every 1 Uncut Support Gem. Every choice you make regarding your build feels almost permanent; people always hated this, and for a good reason, Path of Exile is a franchise built on experimenting, you simply don't have enough freedom to do so right now.

4. Gold is now an integral part of the game, being the main currency to buy items and refund passive points. This system had already been tested in Path of Exile and received a lot of praise... with one complaint. The amount of gold that drops is too scarce, if I want to buy a random ring (that isn't even guaranteed to be rare) I have to spend THOUSANDS of gold, which (at the start of the game) equals to hours of playing. The same applies to refunding skill points, we have an entirely new passive skill tree, new weapons, new skills, etc. and we are still half-locked into tentative choices.

5. This is probably only an issue because of the previous complaints but, the balance feels quite off. It takes really long to kill any enemy, especially some bosses that take 15 minutes of perfect dodging and continuous damage uptime. I think the balancing is based on having decent rare items that are appropriate to your level, but since this is not the case currently (see points 1 and 4), every fight is an unfun struggle.

I won't complain about server issues and the likes because this is the exact reason why we have an Early Access, to iron out things before the full release. This review is to be taken as just feedback from a quite experience player, both in Path of Exile and ARPGs in general.

I'll obviously disregard all the disconnections and the ""login screen simulator"" because, well, we already kinda accept that.

In Path of Exile 2, the entire campaign feels like playing The Mud Flats on Path of Exile 1. The gameplay feels very sluggish, and killing every mob pack is a task by itself. It's not hard at all... it's just tiresome. The boss fights felt the same to me.

I tested 3 different classes, and movement always felt incredibly slow, even with boots with movement speed or playing as Monk with skills that favour movement. The game feels clunky... nothing is snappy. It feels like everything has too much weight and inertia, and you're always struggling to move or do anything (cast a spell, dodge, walk, hit something, open a portal). It feels like slow motion.

Having collisions between players in the same party was a terrible idea, and it feels awful, especially in narrow corridors and passages, even with the rolling dodge. You and your teammates block each other all the time and even walking too close to another player in your party in open areas will be annoying.

Your power scaling as you progress through the game feels as slow as the player's movement. In PoE1 you feel more and more powerful as you progress through the campaign, and you keep feeling challenged by facing larger packs of more powerful monsters. In PoE2, you feel you keep fighting the same quantity, level, and types of monsters you started fighting against, but you feel weaker against them.

In regards to graphics, I understand they wanted to improve the visuals for items and gems, given how beautiful the new graphics of the game are right now, but while chasing for visual consistency, they made it so everything looks the same, and you can't distinguish between things or easily spot what you're looking at. In PoE1, if you fill a tab with different types of boots, you can clearly distinguish them. The same goes for Gems. In PoE2, everything looks the same. All the gear looks like indistinguishable beige scraps, and looking at gems on a stash tab tells you nothing about them.

I could keep writing here about many other aspects I disliked, but I don't want to trash the game, that's not my intention here. Also, after only about 13 hours of playing the game, this should obviously be considered with a grain of salt as it's more of a ""first impressions"" community feedback rather than a full review.

Like me, everyone who has played PoE1 since its beta knows how long it took to become the game it is today (my favourite game). Maybe GGG still has a lot to improve on it, and maybe it will become a better game than it is on early access, but for now, sadly, it feels like PoE2 is for PoE1 exactly what Diablo 3 was for Diablo 2: not the same game with improvements, but a worst and different type of game.

Many of its positive reviews on Steam just say a brief ""D4 bad"", and I don't disagree with the sentiment about Diablo 4. What I'll say is that this game is too much like D4 and too far from PoE1 for me to like it as it is right now.

I can't remember the last time I gave a game a negative review. Honestly, I don't want to give this game a bad review either. I want to like POE2. In fact, I am happy to recommend it later if enough things change. My problem is that, at the moment, the game has too many mechanics that are intentionally designed to prevent you from succeeding unless you get lucky.

There are typical video game barriers that are meant to be overcome where the solution is fun and learning. POE2 requires that from you, but asks for so much more; giving you opportunity, then taking it away without offering you the chance to try again. Did an Atlas Map boss defeat you? Congrats, you can never fight that boss again, forfeiting their loot (which includes more Atlas Maps). Did you get one shot, with 4000 shields, from the perfect combo of Rare Modifiers on a monster right out of the gate? Congrats, you didn't just lose the XP in that Atlas Map, but you lost XP from the last 2 Atlas Maps you completed as well. Did really rare currency drop for you, but you immediately died from invisible ground damage? Too bad. It's gone and there are no ""escape death"" skills available in the game.

It is understandable that people would make the ""Git Gud"" argument. I don't necessarily disagree, but what concerns me is that getting ""gud"" in POE2 isn't fun and involves a lot of RNG. Around level 90 the game just doesn't feel fun anymore and most, if not all, of the endgame activities do not have sustainable mechanisms to help players recover from unfortunate experiences without demanding more time, more risk, and other sacrifices...

I don't have a lot of time to play video games. The holiday season is an exception. The last thing I want is to put an hour into a game only to be worse off than when I started. It's okay to slow progression upon failure, but to take it away feels cheap and un-fun. Video games should be an escape and feel rewarding. Even if I did plow through all of the challenges to hit max level, I don't believe I would feel like the time was worth it. And, I would certainly not want to go through that pain again with multiple characters; potentially one I might like more.

I told myself I would review the game after hitting level 90 to give it as fair of an assessment as possible. There are things I love about POE2, but the endgame, as is, does not want me as a player. It isn't my style. Honestly, I feel as though the design choices I outline in this review (and many more) are antithetical to what gaming is all about.

So I'm not the only one who feels this way. That being said, this review is mostly based on the perspective of someone who played PoE1 before this game. Not for thousands of hours, but enough to compare the game. So keep that in mind while reading this.

I'm not sure if this is the right direction for PoE to go in (at least for me personally).
The game feels very slow compared to PoE1. Combat is slow and a lot more single enemy based. And as many have said, it's more in the style of a souls-like game, than a typical ARPG game.

I think the new boss fights are fun and challenging, but also very slow. Feels like you do basicly no damage, and that causes it to take quite long. Combining that with the fact that you only have 2 flasks now, it's easy to run out of healing if you don't dodge every attack perfectly. Again, more like a souls title. If that's what you're looking for, you'll love it. But personally, that's not what I'm looking for in an ARPG.

The skill tree is there, it's just as big as PoE1, so no complaints there. And I'm sure the end game will be just as expansive as well. But haven't gotten to it yet. And I'm not sure I want to as of now.

New skill gem system is alright. It's nice you don't have to individually level all the gems over and over. But I feel like the skill gem menu could use some work. It's a little cluttered and confusing, and could use some more sorting / filter options.

I haven't experienced a lot of bugs, but I do kept getting caught and stuck on random things while trying to do leaping attacks. So that made it feel a little clunky at times. So in that regard the movement could use some work. But the new WASD movement actually feels quite nice and is a welcome change. I'm sure this will also translate very well to controller gameplay. Which is a big plus for future console players.

If you enjoyed PoE 1 but always wanted it to be a bit more tactical or 'souls-like', this might just be exactly what you're looking for. And you'll probably love it. But if you enjoyed PoE 1 for its fast paced gameplay, zooming through maps destroying everything in your path, you might not like this sequel so much. If you're a new player, or perhaps a diablo 4 player, you'll probably enjoy PoE 2. It's slightly more beginner friendly than PoE 1, and the combat feels a lot like diablo 4. Which is kind of a big negative for me, but might be positive for others.

Overall, the game just feels unfinished to me. Which is totally fair, as it's early access, and not finished. But in its current state I feel like PoE 1 is the better game. If I could give this game a mixed rating I would. But sadly I have to choose between positive or negative, so in this state that would have to be a negative for me. I'll play it some more, to give it a fair chance, but these are my first impressions as of this moment.

I will alter this review if my opinion changes in the future.

Edit:
Played some more, and created a ranger class. Improved the gameplay by a lot compared to the warrior. Clearing speed is so much faster. So it seems like the balance with certain classes and skills is quite off between classes. Mercenary seems especially broken right now with the explosive grenade skill. So certain builds are heavily favored at the moment compared to others. Something to keep in mind if you decide to buy and play.

Edit 2:
Enjoying the game a lot more with my ranger build, but it brings up a core issue. There is a big unbalance right now. Some characters have like 1 or 2 viable builds, while everything else is just kind of bad. While other characters are very easy and have great clear. Currently it seems especially the warrior is very bad, which I had happened to pick as my first character. So that is in part the reason why I had this experience which reflects in my review. For me PoE is all about unleashing creativity and making fun builds, and just copying a meta build is not fun for me at all. So when there is only a view viable ways to play the game, that severely limits creativity, and thus fun.

I'm enjoying the game now, as opposed to before when I wrote this review. But it still leaves much to be desired, and there's definitely issues. I'm confident this will change over time, and it will only get better from here. So as mentioned before, I'm sure I'll give this game a positive review in the future.

But honestly, the bad things causes incredible frustrations that overshadows the good I'm just going to say it - dont buy this game. I'd refund if they'd let me. 

Mobs On-Death Player Kill ; decades later this is still a thing. It serves no purpose other than to slow you down and take the fun away. It's not even a ""let me damage you a small amount of damage and it takes multiple to kill you""- it's literally a 1-shot death, big boss, rare mobs, magic mobs, WHITE mobs can all do it. There are so many poorly visual overlap that you wont even be able to recognize it. So you'll get a lot of ""how did i just die question mark"". 

It's not a die and let's redo it again - because when you die, you lose 10% exp, it's a couple hours of your life when youre 90s+ level. You also lose the map, modifiers, items and all the buffs you put onto that map. It's a 1x try and if you fail you have to reinvest again in order to retry. The thing is, it's not a once in a while thing, it is a CONSTANT thing, every single map and every single mob as the potential to just auto kill you after you kill it. You can spend 300 hours to find an end game boss and dies and have to repeat that RNG again.

At this point - it feels like i'm playing a game where theres' 10 monsters that im using AOE on, and if i accidentally hit that 1/10 mob that's inserted in there, i'll die and lose all my progress. That's literally how it feels. Did I just give GGG a new idea to implement just now? A hidden monster in the mobs that if we kill we auto lose similarly to killing FPS hostages in rescue missions?

The punishment is just absurd - it's always more steps back than forward. You could be grinding 10 hours a day and make zero progress in the game for some very specific reasons. 

- exp lost, you can farm for hours and it just takes 1 death to take it all away
- items balancing - you can farm days for an ""upgrade"" and not be able to use it because you'd have to rebalance your entire 75 minimum resist to even be able to play the game. So no, your ""upgrade"" isnt an upgrade, it's sitting in your stash for days/weeks until you can find the other 5-7 pieces to make it usable. Keep in mind in end game it could cost a fortune per items.
- the balancing ~ literally the game makes it where if you do not have the mandatory resist? you simply dont play the game. Not all stats are created equal but some are just mandatory absurdly implemented. 

GGG can claim to be a game for hardcore all day - but let me tell you something - from a business standpoint? your real $ and revenues inst from the HC players and the dedicated grinders - it's your casuals that works a full time job and can play a few hrs a day. 

Once the hype goes down - expect this game to drop like any other if they keep up with this ridiculous punishment that has no place in today's ARPG. 

Advice for GGG - hire a few psychiatrist and ask them to explain why people play video games and whats actually keeping them playing.

There is absolutely no reward for killing monsters and clearing packs, After about 20 hours of gameplay I have maybe dropped a handfull rares, which most I can't even use for my class and you end up either disenchanting them for 1 regal shard or some gold.
Damage is very slow and character power feels underwhelming, Hit a boss for 7 minutes straight just to get 1 tapped for 5 times in a row, flask charges don't recharge so when you're out of charges during a boss fight.. (even if you roll the mod of 0.15 charges per sec)


The game pace has become extremely slow, tedious and unrewarding. A white mob takes many hits without giving any loot at all 99% of the time, but rares can be even worse. A rare can take long to kill making the game pacing and progression through the acts feel very off and uncomfortable. You'll be lucky if a rare will drop 1 or 2 blue (magic) items. Also very often you'll get surrounded and locked in by a pack of monsters, not being able to roll out or move anymore. So you just stand there taking hits waiting for you character to die while trying to get out. Very amusing.


You get forced to repeatedly grind out areas for XP and hopefully a single 'usefull' drop or orb just so you are able face the next area boss. You'll often find yourself getting completely stuck in a zone, not being able to progress and not having any gold anymore to gamble some items. You'll just have to repeat the zones multiple times praying you can get a single rare drop. Which most of the times does not happen and it's extremely time consuming. IF an item drops make sure to loot it as as fast as you can because if you get 1 shot before being able to loot an item (which happens more than you'd think) all the loot in the map will despawn! So be ready to get stuck in the same map for an hour without seeing any rares. It feels very discouraging and unrewarding.

Every fight feels intentionally drawn out, Every Act area has some sort of boss that deals unfair amounts of damage at a time, when you die to a boss, you will have to start over and the boss' health, and all the monsters in the area will reset.
You get 'forced' to play WASD movement because it's important for survivability to be able to stay moving while casting or attacking.

There is also very little defence on the Passive tree, There are no, or barely any '% Life nodes' On the tree, and there is very little of actual defensive passive you can get. The only 'worthy' defence is Evasion rating currently which many builds dont use at all. Armour barely defends you against hits, especially on higher tiers/bosses. There are very few ways to build life/spell suppression/block/Global Defence/leech/phys conversion/Max Resistance, etc, etc on your tree. These shortcomings become very apparent in late-game maps and in citadels when constantly dying to 1 shots from juiced bosses and after death effects from rares.

If you die in a endgame map, All of your portals will get deleted and you fail the map, so don't even think of trying to juice a corrupted rare map on high tiers. If you die it's all gone. I have dropped a Divine orb in a T14 map, and got 1-shot to After-death effects, losing my valuable divine. When valuable loot drops, I don't get excited but instead very anxious. You have to pick up your loot before getting randomly 1 shot to a field of overlapping after death effects (which has happened multiple times). This is especially bad on tier 15 'citadel' maps. These are rare boss encounters that usually give you expensive fragments, IF you don't get 1 tapped to some random attack/effect, the boss itself can and will just 1 tap you if you are caught off guard. losing and failling your entire Citadel Map and chance at valuable loot! it is just extremely frustrating. Making you scavenge the end game map for your next attempt at a citadel. Just to randomly lose it again. 

Most of the currency orbs have been removed from PoE 1, Like alteration orbs for example, but also the crafting bench is gone. Making it very hard to roll yourself a decent flask, jewel, item, or craft some easy resistance on a open modifier slot for your gear.

The entire soul, essence and feel of PoE is gone, the game is a very unfinished, slow paced, frustrating, drawn out mess.
This game is absolute garbage, unsatisfying, poorly designed. 

There are no redeeming qualities at all. (yet?)

First let's start with the pros: 
- Amazing visuals. Everything looks nice, sharp, with a lot of details. 
- Good performance. The game can run on older devices pretty fine (RTX 2080 no issue). 
- Bosses are cool. They remind me a lot of Elden Ring (which I also love) but only in the early game (campaign)
- Skills are fun (and the variety is good enough) 

And that's it folks... Now for the bad, and there is a lot of it:
- The game is grindy... Yes, yes I know. The company is called Grinding Gear Games. But God damn... I've grinded thousands of hours in PoE 1 but the rewards are so bad and boring that I don't feel the desire to do it anymore
- Skills are cool, but extremely limited. It might sound strange, but the fact you can only have 1 support of each is bad design imo. 
- Ascendancy is garbage. Sure, it should be difficult. But not to the point where newer players give up entirely after failing 10 times in a row
- Crafting is dead... As a big crafting enjoyer in PoE 1, I hate this to no end. Now you just have to pick garbage of the ground hopping to get something decent through the method of Jesus Take The Wheel. 
- End game is a piece of ****. I can't enjoy a game that has such a boring, annoying end game loop... I haven't even got deep into it and I'm already done with it. 
- Skill piano is a thing... People have complained for years about flask piano and considered it to be the worst thing in PoE 1 ever. Now we have skill piano, with obligatory flask ussage (although only 2) and it feels even worse. 
- Visual Clarity is a bad joke. There is so much garbage (beautiful garbage but still garbage) on the screen that I can't see what the hell is happening most of the time
- One shots.... I thought this wouldn't be a problem anymore, but now it's way worse... Monsters can one shot you. Bosses will one shot you. And if you die, the punishment drains all your desire to play anymore.
- Areas are massive and mostly empty. They feel frustrating, boring and more than anything grindy

All in all, I would recommend players to play PoE 2, but only for like 50 hours, the campaign and the early maps. For 30$ I believe that is more than good enough. 
But, for me at the very least, this is not the kind of game I would return every 3-4 months to play again. 

I will most likely sink another 50 or so hours in it and be done. I doubt I'll touch it again untill the full release, and even then I'm not sure if I'll bother with it. ",1734042040,1735117834,False,29,0,0.6426655650138854,0,True,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,negative,100

[b]Update from 01/2025:[/b]

Unfortunately, a lot of things that I don't like about the first part and that were promised for the second part haven't been implemented, for example the death penalty, I mean, what's the point? If I want frustration, I play LoL or Dota Ranked. Unfortunately, things don't progress very well from level 75 onwards, it feels like a lot of hard work to level up here.

The skill tree is very big, yes, but the limited skill points mean you can't get very far out of the starting position.

The Trial of Chaos is just annoying, it's just luck which stupid debuff you get. That then decides whether you get through it properly or whether you get to the boss just before you have a heart attack.

The other Trial of Sekhema is also a joke, why do I lose honor for every fart and then lose even though I'm superior to the opponents and just didn't avoid every micropixel? At level 3 I have to run the instance 3 complete rounds in a row, yeah right.

OK, the Labyrinth Trial in PoE 1 was also annoying, but I much prefer this in comparison!

The endgame only consists of boring map point grinding, I immediately had a flashback to Mario Party 1 or 2 haha. Well, that was done better in PoE 1, especially with the Kalandra League, where you put the maps together yourself and don't have such a boring run through the maps with no goal.

Another hook is that all my skins from PoE 1 are not compatible, but similar skins are offered in the shop, exactly my kind of humor.

Then there are some quests that can't be completed because they're bugged, and leveling up and having to go through the same campaign twice with exactly the same content is too boring for me, I don't feel like leveling up another character.

I'll take another look at the game when it's released as a F2P, but before that it'll be put away in the Steam library.",1733690076,1736715639,False,96,9,0.6423292756080627,0,True,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,negative,100

GGG chose to go all in on Souls ripoff dodge rolling, they chose to go in on Ruthless loot deprivation in Standard league, they chose to add 100 bosses all with generic one shot slams. They've made an experience that's more frustrating and less rewarding than POE1 in every way. I've beaten Dark Souls, POE uber bosses, Shadow of the Erdtree. POE2's Act 1 is as hard as their endgames, and I can't possibly see that as a positive. There aren't even good rewards. The loot is sparse, with Act bosses dropping maybe a couple of blues, and terrible, with those blues being usable by your build maybe 10% of the time. Get a unique? Too bad, it's not for your class!

The new skill system is terrible, with defensive, movement, and buff skills being stripped away for... nothing? Your basic auto attack scales better than every offensive skill in the game?? Defensive abilities and passives have been almost completely stripped from the game, leaving the mighty *dodge roll* as your only defensive option. Even in Act 1 bosses will kill you instantly with every telegraphed attack, generic mob packs can melt fully defensive melee characters in under a second, and things hit so hard you have to dodge individual melee attacks. There are not enough defensive options to build your character to a point where you can survive mistakes or even basic melee attacks without endless rolling. It's repetitive, it sucks, it's very poor design to have only one defensive option with no alternatives. Suck at dodge rolling, have bad reflexes, have a bad internet connection? You just got ""filtered"", bud! Git gud!!!

The game didn't feel like it was opening up the longer I played, it felt like it was getting more unbalanced and oppressive the further I went. By Act 2 the mob density, damage, and health was so outpacing my character that I could barely go a single screen without having to port out and replenish my healing flask, as basic melee attacks were doing over half my health, to a melee class, making the slog even slower and worse. Then I learned to ascend my character they've replaced the fun and enticing Labyrinth with... Sanctum!! Enjoy, melee characters, getting your ascension runs bricked because you can take 10 auto attacks the entire run before running out of Honor! With Act 1&2 bosses having multiple one-shots and minute long invincibility phases where they spam attacks, I'm not sure where the difficulty goes from there, but it's probably not good. 

All of these problems are intentional design decisions. They've chosen to make a slower, harder, grindier, less rewarding game. The story is completely mind numbing, I've never consciously registered the presence of music on anything but the title screen, and the graphics don't look nearly good enough to run as poorly as they do.

Now, I am disappointed.
Indeed, in my opinion (and it is only my opinion), the game doesn't feels good to play. Doesn't feel like Path of Exile.


- Game is slow, movement are slow, no movements spells or dashes

- Maps are HUGE, could be cool, if they weren't resetting when you die, so you have to re-clear the whole map, and thus, take hours to clear a simple map (shouldn't be the case during acts imo)

-No enough checkpoints in some acts / maps, (is problematic because the previous point.)

- Classes aren't balanced between melees and ranged (Melee is tough as hell)

- Lot of bugs (Still in early access, so it is quite fine tbh)

- Small to almost no loots

- Personnal preference : I do not like the dark souls feeling, with the add of the dodge

- Crafting is not as fun as in PoE 1, feels empty

- Passive tree feels too trivial

- Tree passive respec is super expensive

- Lot of boss, and they almost drop nothing, no rewards


There are some goods things tho, graphisms are awesome, acts building are insane (act 2 with the caravan mechanic for exemple). 

I hope these negatives points will be changed in futures patches, and that they will not abandon PoE 1 to maintain this one.

Progression feels lackluster and it's hard to get excited about leveling up when the skill tree, despite being bigger, is full of so much garbage it feels like no real progress is being made. Same with the loot, I got some pretty decent stuff at the beginning but now in Act 2, maybe I'll get a shitty magical item that doesn't even work with my class well at best per map. Crafting orbs are practically nonexistent, at least the ones that upgrade rarity, still have a million Augmentation orbs with nothing worth using them on.

tldr2: post-act burnout, worth it only if you really want to check out what devs have prepared so far and/or support them, but I'm not sane enought to stay for mapping

Grinded to about level 40 and it doesn't feel that good here in EA.

Overall, the game looks beautiful, the ideas are cool, and some boss fights feel genuinely enjoyable—if you're lucky enough to face them on even terms.

Now for the downsides: progression is terrible. The new skill system is more restrictive: it’s divided into ""only maces"" or ""only staves"" instead of the broader categories like ""blunt,"" ""sharp,"" or ""melee."" Experimentation is less encouraged. For instance, in PoE1, testing a different skill or skill combo cost a negligible amount of currency, which was easy to acquire. In PoE2, skills and their modifiers are rare and random loot. A failed attempt at improving your character’s power essentially punishes you until the RNG gods decide to give you another chance.

The same goes for gear. Now, even blue items can't be freely re-rolled: you get just one shot at crafting. If you end up with garbage, tough luck—sell it to a vendor for peanuts. Crafting currency has become rarer, and there are fewer opportunities to deliberately improve your setup. Gear drops have also become less frequent, and it’s all too common to kill a boss, a rare mob, or open a golden chest only to receive absolutely nothing useful or valuable. And this happens over and over.

At state of mid-third act, the game feels like a casino simulator, where players have even less control over the outcomes. This trend aligns with the direction of recent updates and leagues in PoE1.

The gameplay is occasionally unpolished, but mostly just tedious. Maps have become larger, movement is slower, and when you die, trash mobs respawn, forcing you to clear them all over again. With the slower pace, it sometimes feels like certain mobs were designed for the old zoom-zoom gameplay, where you “clear from off-screen or die.” They leap, teleport, or rush at you with absurd speed, leaving no option but to roll away and spam AoE beneath your feet until everything around you is dead. At least, that’s how it feels playing as a ranged character with a crossbow.

The old PoE problems like lack of visual clarity and clear telegraphing of attacks haven’t gone anywhere. The only improvement is that these issues seem slightly less frequent in a few rare cases.

I hope that balancing and loot issues will be fixed by letting devs cook, at the moment it just doesn't feel good

Post act:

Well, I’ve skill-issued myself through all the acts, so here’s the update. The main points have remained the same, and I see the developers are already carefully working on changes, so there will be improvements. You can see how long it took me (45 hours at the time of writing this review). Most of that time was spent walking. My guess is that it could be optimized to around 25 hours (in the best-case scenario) with higher movement speed, a more meta build, proper gear, and efficient pathing. However, even that feels like a lot if you consider having to re-run it for every character in every league.

While I think movement speed in combat is fine, as there are ways to mitigate the slowdown from attacking and to increase general movement speed slightly, we really need something to boost our speed outside of combat. I doubt any developer will read this, but a good long-term solution would be to add mounts, or running, though that sounds less exciting. A mount would be cool, and the game already has some MTX for out-of-combat movement. Besides, there’s an abandoned Rhoa sitting somewhere in Deshar. We can’t just leave this poor creature all alone; maybe it could come with us?

Dodge rolling is already being worked on, but I think each class should have its own way of improving it, whether through ascendancy, a passive tree node, or a gem. While there’s currently one spirit gem that changes how dodge works, I don’t think that’s an ideal solution. 

The best thing about the current gem system is the ability to create skill combos, and I’m excited to see how the developers expand on this idea. However, it feels a bit limited and, in some cases, too restrictive. For example, gas can only be ignited by burning enemies and skills with the “detonator” tag, but not by other explosions, burning oil on the ground, or a literal wall of fire, which doesn’t seem logical.

There are also support gems that cause double status procs on enemies to trigger effects, but I’m particularly interested in seeing them expand on AoE or ground effect mix-ups. It feels incredibly satisfying to use them, and not continuing to develop this idea would be a huge missed opportunity. I also hope weapon restrictions on gems will be eased slightly. While weapon-specific skills are fine and can lead to interesting designs, it’s important to provide more general, all-around options like we’ve had in the past.

Regarding the acts themselves, the best part is generally the bosses, god I hope they'll make pure bossing acts. Act 1 feels decent in this regard, Act 2 is a bit unpolished, and Act 3 is top-tier (though I’m a big fan of Vaal aesthetics, so I might be biased). The bosses I didn’t enjoy were the Kitava-imposter types. I’m not sure if it’s just me, but they feel like they need more work.

In terms of telegraphing and enemy skill audio/visuals: please, for the love of god, ensure survivability isn’t tied to the physical ability to see things under layers of effects. Enemy skills should have visual priority over player skills, with more dangerous abilities having even higher priority, same for sound queues. If things are already hard to see now, we all know how bad it will get after more mechanics and a few leagues are piled on top. There’s a chance now to improve this and avoid the visual hell that PoE 1 became.

The same goes for mobs that rush or offscreen you. This was frustrating in PoE 1 and remains so here. Rushing mobs should be rare packs designed to challenge and surprise you, not something spammed throughout a location. Trash mobs that offscreen you are even worse. Nobody, and this includes us, should be offscreening anyone. It encourages unengaging gameplay, which is, in my opinion, bad. If you want bigger mob engagement distances, just zoom out the camera a bit so we can see each other. And before anyone complains, I’m not referring to things tied to ranged mechanics—I’m talking about things that try to auto-attack you to death.

As for crafting and currency, the absence of Alteration Orbs feels disappointing. No vendor recipes or crafting bench in is also a letdown. Alchemy Orbs don’t exist in the acts (at least not with my luck), and essences are nearly nonexistent. More common Exalts and new Chaos Orbs are fun, but most deterministic crafting methods seem locked away in maps, which I dislike. Omens for crafting appear to exist (based on what I saw on the currency exchange), but my guess is they won’t be common and will cost a fortune to obtain.

The current passive tree is fine—a decent starting point—but it lacks any significant game-changing options. The Atlas passive tree concept, with its own points for each league, is good in my opinion. I haven’t checked upgrades it provides, but the idea is promising.

If you’ve read this far, you’re not sane, exile, and neither am I. I don’t see myself continuing this journey into map grinding, as I see the same issues persisting there.

It has a nice gameplay balance where even if the bosses and acts might be difficult for your character, there's always things to learn so that you can overcome the challenge.
A nice mix of rewarding difficulty, and the bosses are really fun.


However, the endgame is PoE Ruthless mini-hardcore. Pure suffering.
The change between campaign and endgame is actually surreal.
GGG advertised a fair deal on being able to couch Co-Op. Yeah, good luck with that in the endgame.
Ascensions paths are way too difficult, even if you have a decent build (Especially since the bosses are spastic and bugged).
You spend +30 mins just to get smacked by badly telegraphed attacks, and lose all progress. On top of that, if you coop, the difficulty basically scales exponentially.
Endgame loot is scarce and with the 1 portal mechanic, you'll often find yourself punished on multiple levels after getting smacked by on-death events. Nice artificial difficulty. No smoothness at all in gameplay.
The game punishes the player so insanely much.
You can have 70-80% armour and evasion, with ~4k life/es and the game will still throw one-shots at you in area levels 70-85.
And since the game doesn't actually teach you on how to fix this (Which is the norm with PoE), you'll just have to take the loss and use other informational channels to gain knowledge.


Crafting is also abhorrent, and feels almost like a waste of what little currency you're getting. (Even with juiced rare/corrupted maps through towers).
Without any alteration orbs or scouring orbs, it's a pretty much throwing currency out the window 1 out of 100 times.
Sure it can it hit, it just never does it when you actually need it.
Oh boy I sure really do love hitting accuracy, attribute requirements, light radius and low tier mods whilst trying to craft on a ilvl +80 item.
The dopamine of hitting that 100th craft just doesn't outweigh the depression of failing 99 crafts.


Map design is both good and bad. Most maps have a decent set artstyle, but they're just way too large, and some of the layouts are missing clear contrast on impassable terrain, which heavily contributes to being hugged to death.
At least they allowed us to teleport between checkpoints in the campaign, but without a similar function in the maps, the map size becomes tedious. Especially with backtracking towards doing league mechanics, or that one Elite enemy that hid behind a rock when you were traversing the first stages of the map.


Atlas is interesting, but being low-key forced to play every type of map, kills the joy when there are layouts that are painful to play through and that really doesn't cooperate with the league mechanics in terms of much space being allocated to said league mechanic.
Sometimes delirium will last for a fairly comfortable time, other times it'll disappear after 20 seconds.
Ritual being placed in a corridor.
Breach and expedition going through a labyrinth of passages.
Not enjoyable at all.


Honestly felt good about the game with the reveal stream and pre-release videos, and going through the campaign.
But I seriously hope that the endgame will be drastically reduced in terms of punishment towards the player.
Otherwise people just won't play.

I very much disagree with the way changes are happening, the campaign is LONG and it is a significant time investment to get through it. That in itself isn't necessarily a problem just yet since leagues aren't a thing, but GGG has been extremely trigger-happy to push hotfixes that just instantly brick your entire build. 

I wake up on a random thursday morning to find my build that I spent all my resources and like 30+ hours on to not just be nerfed, but to be made entirely unplayable.. Okay, it is early access so changes are expected, but my major issue stems from the fact that re-speccing costs a SCALING amount of gold meaning that I cannot fix my deleted build. This would mean that my only options are to A) grind gold with a build that does not function any longer or B) completely start over with a new character and no guarantee that the exact same thing won't happen to the new build.

Meanwhile a lot of the QoL issues take so much longer to get any attention, it makes for a fairly frustrating experience, in my opinion re-speccing should be totally free in early access so you can adapt to these rapid-fire, extreme changes, because I personally can't be bothered to play more if every character I pump time and effort into is at risk of being disabled while I'm given absolutely no tools to recover.

character movement is slow as hell while enemies can run right to you before you can cast a spell, whcih also punishes the use of fancy combos you could pull of (put down wall of flame and then shoot projectiles through it to empower those, but enemies are already behind the wall even before i finished casting it)

bosses regualrly have attacks that just one or two shot you, which would be somewhat ok when the hotboxes of the attacks were consistent with the animations.

some bosses will regularly swarm you with enemies and trap you and because of the inflatet hp pool of even the most trash mobs of trash mobs you cannot ""just kill them"" easily.

My guess would be that some builds work better then others, but the steep gold costs of repeccing totally kill any experimentation somebody could do.

All maps are too large. All maps are too nonlinear. This was fixed in games back in the 90s. The figured ways to cleverly not have us spend most of our time backtracking with various methods. But making the maps ""linear"" while appearing nonlinear is the best way to do it. GGG has the money. Now please fix it. D4 fixed it. Dont make the same mistakes D4 does - it is a bad omen. All maps and in particular all campaign maps needs to be reduced in size by atleast 60%. All of the monsters can still be here. 

The campagin is too long. Respeccing is too expensive. You dont get enough skill gems to try out the skills like they want us to during ""early access"". Testing a character takes way too long too. Just running through the entire campaign takes so many hours. A 3h run is an extremely far fetched prospect. We are talking 10++++++. Probably 30 for new players. Maybe more. Relative monster level for the difficulty is too low which also makes levelling too slow. Level 79 monsters is the highest average from T15 which makes levelling up an absolute chore. T16 maps is extremely rare. Its basically the divine orb drops from POE1. 

All corridors and doors are too small. They are not wide enough for minions or projectiles to walk through and many builds have to facecheck things. I notice they removed almost all open maps as well. Really? This needs to be addressed. Visibility is already a problem in this game. 

Visibility is a huge issue in the game. Layering is all wrong. Walls covers so we cannot see things. We cannot see the nodes on the atlas because they arent on the top layer. They are covered. Spell effects cover the entire scree so we cannot see anything. Ground effects and ondeath effects cannot be seen due to the visual clutter you added to the game. Best example is probably the chimaera in chimera wetlands where the poison ground is basically impossible to see due to the beautful leaves and flowers on the ground... THAT ARE ABOVE THE POISONOUS GROUND MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE. And this is a continous problem through the entire game. Important visual or audio queues and simply dug down into the grave GGG dug for us and they buried us with it.  Wth guys. This is a serious flaw in a punishing and difficult game. Dying from something we didnt even see or hear. This MUST be fixed. 

Difficulty scaling in POE2 is something like archnemesis from POE1. You randomly encounter a mob that is just extremely fast, spawns on top of you and is faster than you and stuns you. Predicting difficulty of a map, monster or boss is impossible. 

You get only 1 try at maps and bosses and lose your entire investment and all juice on the map node. Terrible design. Especially for new players who basically needs to outgear all bosses so much that they oneshot them with one of the exploit builds to progress through the game.

RIght now the ascendancies are a joke. The game is like Gratz you got level 20! Lets go to sanctum! The funnest league mechanic and die for a few hours. New players, seemingly fall for this evil trick by the game, thinking ascendancies arent so bad. But oh no - you are FORCED to play ultimatum or sanctum which are basically roguelikes but reversed - the best thing about roguelikes is simply misunderstood during implementation. Here you just get weaker. 

Stun threshhold and ailment immunity is not possible to get in this game. A juiced monster can often run up to you and smack you in the face or hit you with arbitrary large aoes that ramps up chill or stuns you and you are poof gone. This cannot be prevented in any way apart from a short immunity with a charm. New players will only have one however and probably not know which one they need at any given time and will just inevitably die without being able to control their character. This is bad design. 

All maps need to get the boss back or we need way to consistently run bosses. Do whichever of this GGG. But right now the boss nodes are the only good ones in maps. While bossing you need a good single target build and ranged class. They are infinitely better and more flexible with position while dealing 100% dps. Melee are melee. Shafted. During mapping we want to zoom. 

All on death effects needs to be removed from the game. What were you thinking? Why can you not challenge us while the monsters are up instead of when they are defeated? Are you so bad that they all have to carry a mine in a different weird colour to try to catch us off gueard? Is that the only way you can challenge us? Force us to farm for 16 hours to get a citadel, but hopefully atleast once catch us blinking or off guard for just a moment and have us die from an almost invisible ground effect or death effect so we lose the entire and only T16 map we had? As well as a big chunk of experience. And the juice permanently removed from the atlas node. Like who designed this? What is the intent behind the decision? 

Minion AI is some of the worst in gaming history. Age of Empires 1 had better AI for movement and pathing for AI controlled units.

Magic Find stats on gear is some of the worst implementations of magic find in the history of gaming. It gives so much that it more than tripples your loot. WIthout it, you are just floundering around getting nothing. You do not have to choices. I play T45 maps and you are stuck farming T15s. That is the difference. You can choose to not play MF and simply not get anything. MF is just like Gacha Games. You can choose to add the sugar back into the game if you just drink from the poison vial. Go ahead. 

Trading in this game is a terrible implentation as well. The entire systems needs remake. 

The atlas needs a complete remake. The towers and hideouts are just griefing us with no reward. I cannot for the life of me find more than a single citadel every 80 hours played. 

Ground effects are the real danger. The bosses are wet noodles. The bosses needs to be more challenging. The maps standard monstes should be swathes of monsters I just brainlessly zerg down. Why? Because standing on your toes squinting and concentrating for 12h+ is not feasible. And this is what is required for this game that does not respect our time. A race takes too long. Levelling takes too long. FInding a citadel takes too long. Trading takes too long. Finding even a single jewellers orb takes too long. If we are to spend so many hours, we must be able to spend most of it brainless. Mindnless. But I want a boss in each map. So that when we get to it it is full focus. Full squint and fivehead. Difficult challenge. And rewarded for it. That is what I want to see from POE2. POE1 zoom through map. All death effects gone from monsters. Archnemesis removed. All negative map effects reduced and difficulty based on tier and MF ON MAP NOT GEAR.

These are just a couple of issues off the top of my head. I'm just tired from writing. This poor excuse for an early access release is really bad and needs to be addressed hard. There is so much to do before what I think will become the game of the year gets its chance. But right now there are so many issues that it is PAINFUL to play the game. You get so punished for so many thing and end up spending HUNDREDS of hours just to test things because they do not respect our time. Its like they dont want us to test their game with such long campaign, such long levell up times, such expensive respecs, such low droprates on waystones and no ascendancy respec. Really GGG. I am so damn dissapointed in you.

But this game is not in a good state. I really like what they're going for here with the world and mechanics(heck, I even stopped to read the lore), but a lot of gripes start piling up when I hit Act 2 and get amplified when I reach the tail-end of Act 3. 

When you start the ascendency trials in Act 2, you really understand how much the devs hate melee. You get this resource called ""honor"" which acts as a new health bar throughout the trial. Now, I'm playing as a monk, so I'm forced to keep throwing ranged spells at enemies or risk losing honor because every enemy is so fast and you're too slow. I was barely able finish the first ascendency trial, and while I enjoy the roguelike mechanics, I do not want to deal with that trial again just to get more ascendency points.

My second major gripe is with respawning. When you die, you'll respawn at the nearest checkpoint. Sounds good so far. But the problem is every time you die, all the enemies come back. They don't just come back either, they get randomized. It's very frustrating having to clear out waves and waves of enemies, only to die to enemies rushing and surrounding you, only to respawn and die because a rare mob spawned right next to the checkpoint. I understand if they wanted it so you're always getting exp... but just let me grind on my own time. I don't want to deal with the same packs of mobs again and again and again. It got so bad in Act 3 that I just wanted to rush through all the mobs and get to the next checkpoint or area. A simple fix would be to keep the current status of the map, but heal the mobs back to full so you can try again.

GGG also keeps nerfing builds people are spending a lot of time on, and the only way to respec builds is by using gold. When you level up, the respec build costs also increase. So when you invest 50+ hours into a specific build, it could all go to waste because GGG decided that build was too fun and needed to be nerfed. I just don't feel the need to keep playing when at any point GGG can decide the way I'm playing is wrong. At the very least during Early Access, respecs should be free.

Next issue is a bit subjective, but the difficulty is way too imbalanced. Some bosses are far too easy to kill, and some bosses are Jamanra. Jamanra not only has a ridiculously high health pool compared to the Act 1 final boss, but he has a total of around 13 moves that he uses across both phases. That is the very definition of over-designed. Basic mobs also feel way too spongey. They constantly like to rush and surround you. Without any good movement skills, most deaths feel insanely cheap and maps feel like a slog to get through.

I still have some concerns for certain systems though. 

- Melee

Playing Melee is for people who want the most challenge...

    1. Melee has way too much wind up in most cases making you over commit to attacks often leading to you dying, while on Merc for example you can move at full speed while shooting making most boss encounters a joke. None of Dmg resist scaling make much of a difference in the late game. So when you do get hit you will die regardless of how hard you spec into defense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Melee as always been something GGG have been massively changing though out all of Poe. Maybe they could make certain attacks have faster animations or give you a Large dmg negation while attacking. Something to give more of a window to attack. 

    2. On MnK Melee often will lock on an enemy your not trying to attack, when trying to slam a specific area to hit the most enemies or trying to attack your bell your character will just attack the enemy closest to your cursor. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An option to remove the lock-on and make it so you just melee in the direction of your cursor for skills you want on the skills screen would be a good change.

 
- Support Sockets

Compared to poe1 the implementation of support gems here is a massive improvement but GGG decided to lock it away through too many hoops in my opinnion...

1. Having 3 Different currencies to expand your support sockets that are more and more rare or having to gamble with Vaal Orbs makes using a Key Feature in your game so much harder to fully utilize. Also note that these are tied to the skill gem itself and not the slot and there are going to be double the amount of skills there are now when out of early access.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maybe Allow uncut skill gems that drop have a chance to have 3 – 5 links already on it making them more exciting drop even in the endgame or instead of 3 types of Jeweller's Orbs just make 2 types; Normal Jeweller's Orb that drops as much as Regal Orbs and Perfect Jeweller's Orb with slightly better drop rate then it is currently. Normal will give you up to 4 sockets and Perfect will give you the final 5th slot.

- Passive Tree

Poe1 wasn't afraid to give power, in the sequel however they are very careful with power, to the point of making build variety shrink. (like always going for Giant’s Blood on Warrior)

1. Navigation of the passive tree is a lot more brutal this time around. Your a lot more keen to make a mistake and having to repec more often on this passive tree. Everything is alot more scattered in most cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make passive highways have slightly less nodes so you can get around the tree. Allow us to go further in the passive tree to make more build varieties.

2. Many Passives have a negative effect compared to poe1. In my opinion this shouldn’t exist outside of Keystones but now its spread throughout the tree which I don’t like.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pls Rebalance GGG and have less Negative effects outside of keystones.

Visuality on maps using a lot of spells is not built for tactical dodges and all that.
There is no desire to overcome a hard foe cause there is no exploration after it. Because it is just a random generated layout. 
Cause there is no fixed loot, cause killing the boss is just pulling a lever on a slot machine. 
And that loot that drops most cases is useless. What unique things do you find? Yeah that's barely usable and a rare item is usually better.

The good:
* Campaign - top notch! Note: only 3 Acts available in Early Access
* Graphics - improved over PoE1 which is to be expected
* Sound design - took me by suprise and is quite good for the genre
* Soundtrack - improved over PoE1 by large margins - boss fights having their own music is great
* Dark Souls inspired combat - some love it / some hate it
* Loot is more simplified from PoE1
* Less currency bloat from PoE1

The bad:
* Crafting - heavily nerfed from Path of Exile 1 as it allows for very little control - you can brick an item that is blue quality and it feels awful
* Dark Souls inspired combat - some love it / some hate it
* Maps bricked after 1 death - teammates can't even revive anyone when mapping together
* You will often find early game loot is vastly superior to late game loot due to poor RNG on stat rolls
* You cannot replace runes already placed in sockets 

The ugly:
* Streamer / degenerate bait
* Stay away if you have bad RNG in games
* If you do play it, I hope you are ready to play it like it's a job.

Early Access is not an excuse for clearly intentional unfun systems.

The maps are a slog to go through, you're most likely going to think it's not that big of a deal but it really is. I have done the campaign with 3 characters and it was honestly the most painful experience I got from an ARPG campaign. 
It wasn't hard, the difficulty isn't the problem to begin with, you're simply always on the edge of being killed so you have to be careful of EVERYTHING and play slowly constantly while spamming dodge roll.
No, the pain came from how long each map take to clear/go through. The maps are immense and you have no movement skill. If you have to full clear a map because you missed a corner you probably spent 25-50 minutes here.
It wouldn't be so awful if the maps had league mechanics to do, sadly it is not the case, it's only trash mobs taking ages to die while being able to two-hit kill you or very rarely an optional boss that gives nothing.

The bosses are cool, I'll give the game that. The designs, animations, patterns are very well done and it is a blast to kill them but those encounters also got a big problem, they were designed to require you to use the dodge roll constantly.
Again you might think it's normal to make the player use a tool for those fights, yes it is, but not when half the moves of the boss one shot you if you miss a dodge no matter your build.
Please understand that later on in the Atlas the maps are ""one time use"", if you die you lose your materials, 10% experience and your time. When you lose a big chunk of the investment you made because you missed ONE roll, I wouldn't call it hard but unfair. Even Souls have very few moves being able to one tap you while you're built to be tanky.

The gem system is very restricting but also very clear for new players. It was said during an interview that even they don't know the combos the players can make but that's a lie.
The gems are all locked to a weapon, which reduce the combo possibilities already.
Worse than that, instead of making support gems work with both attacks and spells they made distinctions. This kills the amount of potential synergies available. To me they restricted those uses because they wanted to narrow down gem combos and have an easier time balancing.

The loot was VERY bad the first few days but now with the buffs it's tolerable, at least when you go through the campaign you can find an upgrade every few hours now. But you are hardly feeling like you earned the loot through hard work, you're more feeling like ""FINALLY a new piece of gear that isn't garbage"". In endgame with juiced content and Magic Find the loot is similar to PoE1.

Magic Find is basically mandatory if you want to feel like you're progressing. Without it you are dropping a lot less currency and the economy is already fucked because of it. Either join them or don't buy any good item. It restricts the builds to a select few, it isn't fun.

I really want to like the game but it's not doing itself any favours. I don't want to think about how bad it would be to go through so many hours of campaign every league. In fact I probably would only make one character per league, if I even bother.
The game is currently not fun because you have to be on edge constantly, the punishment for a mistake like mistiming your dodge roll is too high even against trash mobs and the loot doesn't feel rewarding either. Armour is dogshit, the passive tree is promoting Energy Shield gameplay.

Go play PoE1 and enable Ruthless, it's the same experience and no one liked it.

There's already many nonviable build types, and basically entire skills that are just kinda ""there"" to fill some space right now.
  
It's like they went to the POE 1 buffet and picked all the worst elements and put them in a new engine and gave up after act 3 on innovation.  There's some great ideas, there's some beautiful atmosphere, good writing, but???? you know?

It tries too hard to be D2's successor but does nothing to improve upon it or PoE, for that matter. The game becomes increasingly repetitive and punishing and, to be quite honest, a slog. Classes are undercooked, itemization is non-existent, uniques are utter and complete trash. Passive skill tree is incredibly lazily designed. Drop rates were buffed, but still nowhere near as useful as currency remains scarce, so crafting is out the window. If you're not SSF you're better off trading for gear than finding it yourself.

Dodge rolling may be fun at first but quickly becomes annoying. The issue there is because, while the player has been nerfed to the ground and is playing PoE2, the monsters and their modifiers and abilities come straight from PoE1, good luck keeping your distance or staying alive from projectiles flying your way from outside your screen. 

GGG promised a 50 hour campaign. That might sound cool at first, until you realise the campaign is about 5 hour long, cause their storytelling is incredibly subpar, wrapped up in a 50 hour fat suit of mindless trudging through awkwardly big maps that are designed to make you pull your hair out. During the endgame, you really need to focus on only one type of it if you really want something out of it. So much for the ""quantity of endgame activities"".

Overall, for what was promised by GGG, and for how much GGG's stoic defenders shat on D4 at it's release and still do, PoE2 has the same problems and many more. But people won't say anything bad about them even though they've had 12 years of experience with nearly the exact same team behind it. And for people saying this is just EA and it's to be expected - yes, it's early access, not a beta. You paid money to test a game that shouldn't be in the public eye for at least another 2 years.

There is a temporary fix that may work for some, not for me.
It involves running the game with certain cores disables or without multithreading at all (enjoy those 30 fps!).
I can only prevent the game from freezing by disabling multithreading from the in-game options.
Game runs poorly now, even on my 4080. 15-25 fps in hubs, around 40-60 fps in combat zones.
Love the game heaps, but can't recommend as of now.
Will update this review when it's fixed.
If you don't run into problems, the game's a solid 10/10 for ARPG lovers who like a challenge.

Nothing has changed. Sometimes I can manually disable cores and play for a couple of hours. Other times it keeps freezing indefinitely upon firing up the game and I have to stop and try again later. Very unnerving.

Still no fix. Someone on the forums here said GGG have been on hiatus these past two weeks and aren't working on a fix, yet. Can't really comment on that.

While the game has many many fun and high points, the lows and frustrations are also incredibly rampant.

Pros: 
- Great visuals, plenty of uniques from PoE1 were reintroduced in POE2 but with a new visual update and they look absolutely amazing.
- Game runs much smoother than its predecessor 
- The campaign is good and quite fun to play, despite there being only 3 acts of story. (You redo the 3 acts in a higher difficulty, GGG will add more acts as time goes on)
- Boss fights. Oh my god did they ever do such an amazing job with the boss fights. The fights are meant to be longer than what you are used to in POE 1. Every boss has its own special mechanic or unique set of abilities that define them. While some builds just evaporate the bosses, you lose a lot of the fun and what makes this game so great in the complexity of these bosses. 
- Better than D4

Cons:

- The large maps with low movement speed and lack of movement abilities, the only good movement ability is blink but has quite a high cooldown and most classes will never use it. Other movement abilities (dodge roll, shield charge, leap slam) All have strange collision which can lead to many many unfortunate things happening as you don't always roll/charge/leap the direction you want monsters can effectively create a wall causing you to roll along them instead of through.

- Passive tree. The tree is big but it feels incredibly empty, a lot of the passive points you are using end up being used to travel from one side of the tree to another. The tree also favours heavily into lightning damage and spell casters which limits a lot of builds

- Builds. While poe.ninja does not yet exist for POE2, the majority of players have about 1-3 builds to really pick from if they want to experience all of POE2's endgame. With the passive tree heavily leaning towards energy shield and lightning damage, the majority of players are forced to take that path or be extremely limited in progression of your atlas.

- Ascending. There are four ascensions you can do for your character to increase their strength. The first two ascensions are a challenge but not impossibel to d

- Crafting. If you've played POE1 you know that crafting is one of the core components in the game and it also attributes to a lot of its fun. What GGG has done to crafting in poe2 is more of a gamble than actually crafting. With the removal of deterministic crafting, to get any good gear now you sort of have to pray you get lucky with your exalt slams. Access to crafting materials is very gated, whether it be very hard to find the materials you are looking for, or you are just simply too poor to afford omens/greater essences/distilled emotions.

- The Atlas. While the introduction of the atlas seemed really cool and interesting at first, it has some problems of its own. I was not able to find a Citadel for the first 100 hours or so I spent mapping, you need to find three separate citadels before you can challenge the pinnacle boss. Your atlas is generated via a seed that is locked to your account, so if you were to get an unlucky seed or head off in the wrong direction it takes a while. There are players who reported to not finding a citadel after days of just mapping.
There has been a report of a player's atlas who was bugged and he could not progress further.
If you were to move far enough away and try to back pedal in another direction on your atlas, parts of it will not load. To remedy that you're forced to do a map near that area to force the next area to visually load on your screen. Towers  were introduced as a form of ""juicing"" your maps but they feel like the sextants from poe1 but on crack. Sextants were removed from POE1 two leagues ago, adding them back in the form of towers seems like a strange process to me. 

- Mapping. GGG took a new approach to endgame mapping now with nodes that you travel across an atlas, similar to navigating a passive tree. What they didn't tell the playerbase was that maps are now only 1 try per map. If you die you lose your waystone, map, the potential loot/exp and 10% exp. With 1 portal being what seems to be the new norm, players are then again forced to either play incredibly safe or play one of the few meta builds that kills everything really fast while being just as tanky.

- Monster packs and on-death effects. While GGG updated visuals for the game and scenery looks amazing. The lack of distinction between a normal/magic/rare monster is quite concerning. In POE1 they were identified easily by a blue hue around them for magic and a yellow hue around them for rare. 
 I am not sure why GGG has decided to give almost every other monster pack some form of on-death effect. Whether they drop a pool of damage that does DoT while you stand on it, or they just explode it has become 
one of the most infuriating things that a majority of the player base die to. 

- Pinnacle bosses and map mechanics. While the new atlas tree looks spectacular and I like what they did with it. Accessibility to other trees is near impossible without a lot of time dedication or you spend the ingame currency to buy access to it. I've clocked about 350 hours and I have no points in 3 of 5 of the mechanics. With such limited access to these pinnacle bosses and with only one chance to get the fight right. Players are then forced to either look for someone to carry or play one of the meta builds in order to beat said boss.

- GGG going radio silent. While I understand it is the holidays and that people deserve to be with their families and loved ones during that time. I do not agree with shipping a new early access product, supporting it for 2 weeks and then complete silence for the following 2. While this may have worked with leagues in POE1 it was because the game was in a stable spot and any fixes that were required were addressed fairly easily.

1. Fix your auction house system! 

Having to use a clunky external website, search for an item, then try and find a player GENUINELY selling it who's online, message them, hoping they actually reply, then try and group up with them in game, then manually trade said item is laughable in 2025.

2. Remove lame one shot mechanics!

Even with defensive talents and gear, energy shields, screen wide curses that reduce enemies damage, as well as capped resistances, you still get one shot by random mobs. This brings nothing to the game except a form of frustration for the player, and greatly limits your build choices and playstyle! 

Hell, the game doesn't even do the decency of telling you what led to your demise! One second you're alive and kicking, the next your presented with a respawn button and massive chunk of xp removed (at endgame).

3. Make uniques great again!

What's with the same useless, low level uniques dropping at level 90 in stacked t16 content, as at level 10! And why are they so...bad! It's like diablo 4 all over again! No rare colors and awesome, class changing gear to chase and get all excited about,  just more minor boosts and stat spreadsheet comparisons on rare/yellow gear. Yawn! 

4. Game needs some serious optimisation!

Getting 40 fps on a 4080 at 4k with settings on medium and dlss on Max performance is pretty horrible. Id hate to see what other people are getting but it can't be good, especially when a big part of the game is overrunning you with a zerg of enemies which has the greatest impact on your FPS.

5. Improve endgame variety!

One of your big selling points was hundreds of bosses, but with the current state of endgame 99% of your time will just be spent killing trash. At least give us some more variety and the ability to just fight bosses should players choose!

The Good: The new gameplay mechanics feel good, the WASD movement feels great, the new skill gem system stop making gearing as much of chore of needing both good stats AND good sockets.

The Bad: I don't think GGG played melee or minions AT ALL when testing. On-Death effects don't affect ranged builds, ranged enemies do more dmg than melee enemies, enemies dashing into you can move you upwards of a full screen away (massive CC), and using a move that moves you causes you to get body blocked on enemies (also CC). This makes melee just statistically worse than ranged. The fact that the first ascendancy also uses Forbidden Sanctum is just another slap in the face to melee, as it is quite easy to do on ranged, since you can just kite.

Minions run the problem that they body block themselves and you and have worse AI than PoE1, so this causes them to get stuck in doorways a LOT especially when you amass an army of them, and them body blocking you is once again more CC on you. The minions are also extremely squishy, making the permanent ranged ones the only viable endgame option, as the Reapers and Brutes have the problem of being melee and zombies and Unearthed minions are temporary, which die if you get too far away, instead of teleporting to you, like they do in PoE1.

I can see what they're going for with PoE2, but they need to make melee actually playable, and melee minions actually tanky while also not body blocking. They also NEED to remove the fact that enemies walking into you is CC, ESPECIALLY for melee since if you go to swing at an enemy, but get dashed into right as you do, your attack is now out of range. Not to mention, PLEASE REMOVE THE ON-DEATH EFFECTS almost 80% of the enemies have them, they do a lot of dmg, armor cannot reduce the physical ones, they often come out faster than you can react and move away. The bosses are monumentally easier than literally any of the mobs as a melee, while the bosses are harder on ranged because of squish.",1736102526,1736102526,False,8,0,0.575680673122406,0,False,True,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,negative,100

Overall, the game is quite good, a fresh and engaging iteration of the well-known Path of Exile formula. However, there are a few rough edges worth mentioning:

- Respawning areas upon death: This feels needlessly punishing and disrupts the flow of gameplay.
- Oversized areas: Some zones feel unnecessarily large, as though compensating for a lack of content. While this is understandable for an Early Access title, the later areas in Act 3, in particular, are uninteresting. There’s little to explore—just long, tedious slogs to get through.
- Clunky skill gem system: Why are skill gems drops rather than being tied to levels or a more manageable system that offers flexibility? It feels like this system exists mainly to encourage purchasing skill gem tabs.
- Low drop rates: Loot feels sparse, which can make progression slower and less satisfying.
- Crafting feels like gambling: The crafting system leans heavily on RNG, removing many of the deterministic mechanics from Path of Exile 1. The removal of alterations and scours in favor of exalt slamming makes crafting feel more like praying to the RNG gods than a thoughtful system.
- High respec costs: Respecs are far too expensive, which is limiting experimentation.

Despite these issues, I genuinely enjoyed the game once my build gained traction. Once the speed and efficiency increased a bit, it made the gameplay more fun and rewarding for me.

Unfortunately, that experience was short-lived. When GGG released a new patch, it effectively bricked many builds, including mine. While I understand that this is Early Access and balance changes are expected, the high cost of respeccing (which exceeded my current gold) leaves me at a dead end. 
I’m not upset about needing new gear for a different build but without enough gold to respec and no viable way to earn it without a functioning build, I’m stuck. Sure, I could grind low level areas to slowly accumulate gold, but there really are better ways to spend my time.

If you're going to drastically nerf builds during Early Access, at least make respeccing free or significantly cheaper. Early Access players are your playtesters and are essentially paying to help you refine the game. Let them experiment freely.

I’m reluctant to start a new character, knowing there’s a risk the same thing could happen again.

Constantly crashing when changing Support Gems and Equipment.

Constantly crashing before entering the map when trying to do Endgame/Waystones with friends. Unless it's meant to be done by yourself...Which I hope is not the case.

Unpleasant microtransaction practices so they can squeeze a few more dollars off of you. The official website also needs to be more transparent on what cosmetics work for which Path of Exile game. At the moment they are just thrown in together with no indicator.

- Thoughts -

• Tiny Inventory
The inventory space is really small. So if you're picking up equipment you will constantly be warping back to camp. This wouldn't be that big of a problem if gems, skills, and equipment had their own unique tab.

• Gold
Not enough gold. Quantity piles of gold instead of quality. Unless you're constantly warping back to camp to sell all your items. Skill points are also really expensive to reallocate. Especially with all the current and future nerfs happening.

• Loot
Feels lackluster, even more so from bosses.

• Body Blocking
New players starting out will find this very frustrating. It wouldn't be an issue if there was a way to get of of it without having to simply just kill the mobs.

• Walking Simulator
Allow us to teleport to checkpoints around the map we're in.

• Melee
Doesn't feel bulky enough. You melt like butter, and taste like a rare steak. It also feels like Path of Exile 2 punishes you for playing Melee characters. (Example: Honor System)

• Endgame
Very punishing and frustrating. I hate the fact that you only get one life each map, and the fact that you can lose hours of experience gained over a single death.

I spread the word, convinced friends to try it, and eagerly purchased early access on day one. Unfortunately, I now find myself writing this review with deep disappointment.

One month after launch, the game remains unplayable for me due to persistent technical issues. Running on an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D with Windows 11, the game frequently freezes my entire PC during teleports, forcing a full system restart. While there's a workaround - disabling a few CPU cores - it impacts performance and doesn't completely fix the crashes. Instead, it reduces them to game-only crashes, which are still frustrating. Another approach is to disable Engine Multithreading before every teleport and re-enable it afterwards. While this method works, it completely breaks immersion, and forgetting to toggle it even once results in the same freezing issue. Worse, the game can freeze during startup, leaving no opportunity to make adjustments.

The game itself also falls short of expectations. Only three of the six planned acts are available, and yet players are required to go through them twice to reach the endgame, which quickly becomes repetitive and boring. The maps are unnecessarily large but offer little reward for exploration, and most classes and builds lack meaningful movement options for much of the game, making traversal feel like a tedious grind. On top of that, the game punishes players excessively for dying. Losing everything because of one mistake, or worse, dying to on-death effects, makes the experience more frustrating than challenging.

The new ascendancy system is another disappointment. It's hard to believe it made it into the live version of the game, as even the original Labyrinth feels like a better alternative in comparison. To make matters worse, [i]Path of Exile 2[/i] seems to have taken a step backward in QoL features. Fixes to issues players raised in the original game are mysteriously absent here, and it feels like GGG is stubbornly pushing unpopular mechanics simply because they believe they're good ideas. Even simple features like an auto-sort button or the option to skip the campaign after finishing it once are still missing.

Despite all these issues, I have to acknowledge that the game's atmosphere, graphics, visual effects, music, voice acting, monster variety, boss designs, and core combat are all exceptional. These elements showcase the potential [i]Path of Exile 2[/i] could achieve if the developers addressed the glaring flaws. However, in its current state, the game is a massive letdown. I can't recommend it to anyone, especially since the full version will eventually be free.

While visually polished, PoE 2 delivers fantastic and exhilarating boss fights, showcasing Grinding Gear Games' mastery in creating thrilling encounters. However, the levels are far too large for the painfully slow movement speed, and the lack of build creativity—mirroring Diablo 3's skills both in design and appearance—leaves much to be desired. Loot drops are conspicuously absent on maps, and restrictive stat requirements stifle cross-classing potential, further limiting player freedom.

If you loved PoE 1 for picking up loot, trading, crafting, and making the screen explode with action, do not play PoE 2. But if you prefer slower, MOBA-style gameplay, PoE 2 might be worth a try.

Grinding Gear Games could have a world-class, perfect game if they removed weapon restrictions on skills, adopted the same freedom as PoE 1, sped up the action by 100%, and brought back the old currency system while keeping gold—revolutionizing vendors and making them both valuable and fun to engage with. Also, why isn’t there a vending machine-style interaction for player trading? It’s 2025—why do I still have to PM for a physical transaction?

And the thought of playing through Act 3 again any time soon is already exhausting.

ARPGs are supposed to be all about loot, but loot is pathetic in PoE2. And what little drops is completely worthless - like a normal rarity item with a base 30 levels below the current area (best I've seen: white lvl 16 gloves in a lvl 56 area). You're supposed to ""craft"" but there's no crafting in this game. You can only use various orbs to add completely random mods to items which will be worthless 99% of the time. Found a cool armor that just needs life to be an improvement over your current piece? Enjoy using a rare exalted orb to add +4 to maximum life. The end result is that you can often feel weaker as the game goes on and your few ""good"" pieces of armor from 15h ago start showing their age.

If you enjoy the melee playstyle in these games, know that the PoE2 designers actively despise you. Everything is made to make melee feel terrible - many enemies have on-death effects or stand in degen pools, and half your stronger passive points come with a nice -10% attack speed just in case you ever felt too fast with your 2 seconds swings. And it's not like you're tanky either - if your power fantasy is to be a big immovable wall, this won't happen here. You'll have to kite even basic monsters like everyone else because otherwise you'll just die in a couple of seconds.

PoE2 wanted to be the ""Dark Souls of ARPGs"" and succeeded at being neither. There is no reason to play this over Path of Exile or Elden Ring. And if you just want to play the campaign once to check it out - might as well wait until the full release when it'll be F2P.",1733956099,1733956099,False,43,1,0.5606871247291564,0,True,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,negative,100

CONs
-Slow campaign
-Painful gearing process - from early campaign to maps, the solution to getting gear is simply go to the trade website
-Insanely huge maps - why does it take 25 minutes to clear a T3 magic map?
-One shot mechanics are alive and well, despite SIGNIFICANT investment in survivability in the tree and items
-Painful on-death mechanics, especially in maps. Nothing hurts quite as bad as seeing an expensive item on the ground after dead

PROs
-Great boss fights (minus one-shots with minimal telegraphing)
-Great art/design/UI
-Combat generally feels great, despite being SLOW

Understand the game is in Early Access, if you're liking it, that's awesome. I certainly enjoyed the game for most of the hours I put into it, but the CONs listed above have killed my enjoyment.

Wolf Boss is Tuned to Hell. So far bosses in Act 1 are more mechanically complex than the entire campaign of PoE 1. New players should expect to hit a wall quickly.
My sentiments agree the with the present dissenting reviews of the game:
1) The developers intended to produce a game which had more in common with the Souls-like genre than the original Diablo (2) clone of the original Path of Exile. This is a betrayal of the players whom are passionate and addicted to the former game. A departure in genre is not inherently evil, however, to modernize the previous engine, make minimal effort to visually differentiate between the two, and simply increment the version number is a fundamental failure of branding.
The second preview video speaks to how poorly they differentiated the two- I encourage the reader to watch the trailer and attempt to spot the differences- the UI is an intermediate state between the two games- 5 flasks are featured instead of 2, and the spirit meter over the mana bar and presence of the portal button are unique to the 2nd game. Without simply asserting that change is bad, this marginal change in visual style fails to prepare the veteran player for the jarring differences in mechanics.
Notably, PoE 1 is a game where the player is expected to obtain a power level which almost trivializes most combat encounters. And from an early level. Boss fights have the potential to be challenging, and may require the player to focus on survival and endurance. This is heavily contrasted with this games desolate, and oppressive attitude towards encounters. The lowest ranks of enemies and consistently threatening and attack in large mobs. Higher tiers of enemies have the damage and persistence to be greater threats than the named boss fights. Items are scarcely dropped and the player is constantly experiencing a position of oppression where the environment is a substantial challenge to be overcame.
2) Alluded to in the comparison between titles, PoE 2 is not a particularly rewarding Souls-like. Encounters routinely (read nearly always) have two or thee phases with individual health bars rivaling entire fights in the former game. Spaces are tight and maneuverability is limited thought the first act. The inclusion of checkpoints is a welcomed change, though the union of a checkpoint and a disproportionately wide semi-open box is a tired cliché indicating a protracted fight to follow. The experience is unvaried and loses its luster after the first or second repetition. A single enemy will manifest with high mobility and health. Their attacks will feature stuns which chain into massive damage area of effect (AoE). Attacks routinely deplete half or all one’s health in a single blow and affect a portion of them map exceeding (70 or 80)% of the playable surface. Fights are inter spaced with phases where the primary antagonist becomes immortal and the player is forced to defeat a sizable pack of base enemies within the greatly reduced area of the boss arena. This process repeats for multiple minutes before a health bar is depleted, the primary antagonist transforms and the process must be repeated for the next phase. Routinely these fights have 3 phases spanning in encounter duration of multiple minutes to fractions of an hour. Dying at any point, most often to a single hit, forces the player to restart from the beginning of the entire encounter.
These fights are long and arduous. A test of skill and ability, but they fail the reward the player. No dispensation of items or currency arises which uniquely rewards the players persistence. Plainly, the player will earn more, for less work, in a fraction of the time be remaining among the common enemies. Here, PoE 2 fails to achieve its ambition of being a souls-like. Fights become repetitious, tedious, and unrewarding. Fatigue sets in and the player is left questioning if the outcome merits the abuse. Some may revel in the suffering, but I find no joy in being broken and battered by a loved one.",1733614247,1733635974,False,7,0,0.5604974627494812,0,False,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,negative,100

But I do recommend it, I enjoyed this game.

To be clear. I am a massive BioWare fan. I’ve played all their games (even Shattered Steel on my dad’s old PC from the 90s). I’m going to go down the different aspects of the game below.

Technical level/business decisions: in my entire 54 hour playthrough I had absolutely 0 crashes. 0 frame drops and only 1 bug, that I easily fixed with a quick fast travel. The game runs flawlessly which is a great thing. Also, EA for some reason let BioWare cook this thing with no other BS like Denuvo, MtX, requiring EA app, etc.

Visuals/art style/envirments: it’s no secret that the discourse for this game on its art style is tumultuous. But when I actually sat down to experience it, I grew to like the art style quickly. The envirments are absolutely stunning, and there are a LOT of different environments. Animations are also surprisingly stellar for a Frostbite engine game. There are moments where the animations are janky and not immersive, but overall I was incredibly impressed with the visuals. 

Gameplay/combat: surprisingly one of my favorite parts of the game. Progression and skill tree is really expansive, and has an absolute massive build craft options (respeccing for free too!) the combat is an amalgamation of God of War 2018 combined with Mass Effect 3, and came together really well. Builds can become so OP I had to increase the difficulty.

Accessibility: every aspect of the games interface and accessibility can be changed. You don’t like the HUD? Turn it off, you don’t like damage numbers? Turn it off. You love difficult games but hate “bullet spongy” enemies? Do the custom difficulty and turn enemy health down and everything else up. A truly customizable experience for everyone. And it works really well.

Writing/Dialogue: this is where things start to decline for me a bit. BioWare has always impressed me with its writing. Specifically its companions, and this game for me, it large succeeds only in specific companions. The overall writing of this game all over the place. The tone changes regularly, the dialogue is off in many ways. It has such a safe, “neutered” writing in its dialogue. The majority of conversations you have are met with brevity and optimism. I did not like this. So many companions didn’t have nuanced arcs, as much as I was interested in their characters, save for a few. So many safe options taken, no states within your group really happen, and no matter what choice you make the group never really experiences tension with each other save for maybe 2 conversations.
In contrast though, there are moments and characters that showcase the power of terrific BioWare character writing. Every conversation with Solas was gripping and incredible, no small thanks to his VA, who did an amazing job. Also, characters I originally hated when I met I grew to like and even adore as their story progressed (shout out to Bellara). And of course, the ending sequence of this game, which can take upwards of 3 hours to complete, is the absolute best part of the entire game, filled with twists and turns and tough choices. It sucks that it had to be the ending to get all those big moments. 

In conclusion: I was initially disappointed as it seemed BioWares writing was at its weakest with this game. As I played though. The writing and even dialogue got a little better, and a little better. And by the end I was fully immersed. 
This game is very clearly biowares “clean slate” moment. A bridge to open a new era of BioWare to us after years of nothing save for 2 disappointing games. I genuinely believe if you are a new fan to this series, you will enjoy this game a lot. If you are a casual DA fan, you will enjoy this game as well. And if you’re a hardcore DA nerd you may struggle with the tonal shift and deflated companions in comparison to others.

There's a lot of fuss around the game right now so here's an honest review:

[b]Gameplay:[/b] This game is an action RPG. If you're expecting something like BG3, this isn't for you. If you like the genre, the gameplay is great. 

Exploration - You have multiple areas to explore, even though it is not open-world. I'd say it reminded me of the God of War type of exploration. You have some small encounters with enemies in that area, some loot around it, codex items, and chests. 

Quests - You have main quests, companions quests and area/faction-related quests. They definitely put more work into the main plot and for that reason, I had the feeling that every area/faction-related quest was somewhat tied to the story and I felt the need to complete those before moving on to the next main quest (probably explain the number of hours I've played), that being said I don't think you NEED to complete everything, but it was interesting to see how every faction was doing in the middle of that chaos and what their initial problem was. 
Companions quests as always are there to solve their personal issues, some are more fun than others, but overall it's pretty decent. 

Decisions - Some decisions were presented during the game, a few definitely had more impact towards the end than others, and some of those just changed a few details. And yes, people can die depending on what you do or well... don't do. 

[b]Difficulty/Combat:[/b] I personally loved the combat, and I played around with the skill tree a LOT until I finally decided what I wanted and which style I preferred. How hard the game is, is up to you. You can tweak it to your liking pretty much everything and have custom settings. Enemies health bar, aggression, how much damage towards you. Just play around and find whatever fits you. 

You can make combos with your teammates, using different types of abilities and I kind of decided my team based on as many combos as possible considering my own abilities and theirs.

Overall, combat is pretty dynamic and cool to see when you have multiple enemies firing at you from a distance while a huge ogre is trying to charge at your sorry archer's ass. 

[b]Story:[/b] This is a hero's journey to its core. No, you can't be evil. No, it's not the traditional RPG. And yes, everyone just wants to be hopeful that everything will turn out ok, yada yada. That being said, I adopted the ""For sure this game has no interest in actually sad outcomes"". I gotta say I was not expecting some of the bits towards the end when it came to it. 

Main plot - I personally enjoyed a lot following the main quests. There were no moments during the main quests that I wasn't fully into it. Nostalgia definitely hit me multiple times. It was engaging enough for me.

Dialogue - You have dialogue options that don't really impact outcomes (which is different than the decisions you are presented from time to time), so you know, dialogue options are there more as a do you want to be nice? Cope with humour and crack some jokes? Or just go straight to the point? It doesn't really affect anything but the other character's way of answering you too. A few times I noticed one or two companions approving/disapproving of something, by the end I realized that those rare answers were a minor decision on something. 
It can be goofy or cringe sometimes, but there were moments I laughed or I felt bad/happy about it. And to be completely honest the ""bad writing"" moments felt as stupid as every other Bioware game I've played, nothing new. And I loved those games as well. 

Factions - Your faction does change characters who talk to you and does allow you to see other dialogue options. It was interesting. 

Companions - This is probably where the opinions divide the most. Some of the companion's personal stories are definitely more compelling than others. At some moments I did have to push some of their questline a little bit with the hope that would have some payoff by the end of it. And you know what? I think it did for the most part. Not every companion has the ""perfect resolution"" no matter what you decide/do, and I liked that. 

For those complaining about ""woke"" stuff or ""LGBT propaganda"" related to one of the companions, I'll say: Yes, the companion does talk about their gender and if I put together all the bits of cutscene or dialogue related to that, it will give me around 5-10 min in total within the 60h it took me to complete EVERYTHING. So no, it's not pushing anything down anyone's throat. Whether you decide to do their quest or not, is completely up to you. You can love or hate the character but don't say that Bioware never had LGBT characters before, because it did. If that's your ONLY excuse to hate the game, then I'd recommend using your 2 inches of brain and time to play something else instead of crying all over the internet. 

[b]Conclusion:[/b] It's a pretty solid and fun game to play. Maybe it's not the Dragon Age many of the fans were expecting. I personally didn't know what to expect cause I feel like Bioware is always changing the way they approach their games. The essence is there. The lore is there. And it was a great 60-hour journey. If you're like me, don't care that much for the occasional stupid jokes or not being able to be the chaotic character/reason for despair of that world, then just give it a try.  Hope that helps.

I played Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age Inquistion, more than one time. And i will play this game more than one time. Because i like it.

It took me about 70 hours to complete it with all the achievements and shit. And i wasnt bored for a single second.

The Gameplay was very giga big baba bubu fun! I enjoyed it really hard.
The Story was good. It won't throw Dragon Age: Origins off the throne, but it was a good story.

I can not say that all dialogues were written very well, some felt very...random/unnatural (in dialogues with companions). But the Voice Actors did such a good job, i forgot about that. Respect to them tho.

Also i had ZERO bugs or any other problems. I mean. This should be normal, maybe a few, but these days...its not normal. So yea!

Something that would also be worth mentioning: I liked many new...informations about the lore, how things are..or was...or will be, very interesting!

So overall. It's a good game. And for me: It's still a good game in the world of Dragon age.

I enjoyed aspects of the game. 

As a standalone game, The Veilguard is fine, and gets better after the weak first act. As a Dragon Age game, it’s the worst in the series. It would be easier if the game was just bad, but there are sparks of hope every now and then. I love the setting so much, and wanted this to be a return to form. 
Most of the story design choices are just baffling, if not downright insulting. They absolutely butchered legacy characters and all previous player choices. It feels spiteful. I hope that if we get another Dragon Age game, there are big changes with how the leadership and writing team approach the story. Trespasser was such a great set-up for new adventures, and the current dev team fumbled an easy win. It’s actually devastating to witness as a long-time fan. 

I know the culture war tourists have labeled the game “woke”, but it’s really not, and I say that as someone who would be called “a woke” by these people. This is pure sanitized US corporate fluff. It’s not about inclusivity, it’s about being as inoffensive as possible in order to sell more. 
You won’t find any uncomfortable politics here. Religion and basic cultural elements are barely there, when they’ve previously been central to the setting. The revelations in the game should be society shattering for the entire continent, but nobody cares. Everything is sanitized, and no one gets to be morally grey. You’re either good or comically evil.

Thedas has such a wealth of messed up situations with amazing story potential.
The city elf is one of the best origins, and it’s brutal. I still think about encounters like the Broodmother and quests like All That Remains. Or the elven inquisitor getting called a rabbit the moment they step into the Winter Palace, and starting the quest at a disadvantage. I wanted the kind of hopeless horror that shows the world and its people are very much flawed, but still worth fighting for. None of that is present here. 

The Lords of Fortune are a good example of the toothless writing. What do you mean these treasure hunters don’t loot tombs? Or that they have cultural advisers so they can return artifacts to their rightful owners? The faction is led by a pretty well-known cultural artifact thief! Let them be shady.
We finally get to see Tevinter, and it’s just a load of nothing. Why is there nothing with the Imperial chantry? The Magisterium? Slavery? What’s the point of the Shadow Dragons, when we see none of the horrors we’ve spent three games (and countless other forms of media) hearing about? Yes, Dock Town is the place for the lower classes, but you’re telling me that slavery isn’t visible in any way? At the docks?! How do you even make Tevinter this boring?
Show us the brutality of the Antaam occupation, instead of just telling us it’s bad. Let us see the casual cruelty of Tevinter culture, instead of hiding it in the codex. Let the elves be angry instead of happily embracing atheism and other species. 

The game tells you things without letting you see, shape, or just experience the events yourself. It tells you how to feel and doesn’t allow any deviations. 
I’m pretty much always a goody two-shoes player, so it should work for me, but this game made me wish for evil options. Or just the chance to tell some characters to go pound sand. I would absolutely embrace the Dark Urge with some of the story beats, and it’s such a weird feeling to have with Dragon Age. 
A big issue is the writing. I’m not expecting archaic language (though I’d prefer it), but almost all characters speak like they know what TikTok is. It’s not like the series ever had everybody speak like Morrigan, but the constant quips and meme-like reactions were too much this time. Everybody reacts like they know there’s a camera on them. The voice-acting being all over the place doesn’t help. The only consistently brilliant performances among the companions were Emmrich and Davrin. 
I get the devs wanted to focus on new players, but they could’ve done it so much better. Games like BG3, The Witcher 3 or WotR are good examples of how you don’t need to coddle new players. The games were worth the learning curve, and Dragon Age should be worth it too. 

I’m also confused by the reviews that said this is the most focused game yet. It’s really not? The pacing is wonky from start to finish. Most heavy emotional beats just didn’t land. The hyped “big choice” happens way too early and makes very little sense. My character doesn’t know these people, and I, as the player, only got here as well. At least let my character explain/defend their choice, instead of making him self-flagellate uselessly while basically being called a heartless war criminal. 
The game would be so much better if it started with Rook’s origin story, instead of constantly telling us how cool it was. The story also would’ve benefited from being much smaller in scale, or from spending more time building up to the initial ritual. I’m not sure how new players would even care about Varric with how lackluster his presence is. The same goes for the other legacy characters. They’re just shallow imitations of themselves, completely stripped of their context.

The friendships and romances are barely there. The game kept telling me that these companions were my character’s found family, but never actually showed it. It honestly felt like the others didn’t even like Rook. Having finished the game, I’m not even sure why he was there at all. 
A faction related quest for Rook specifically would’ve helped establish him in the world. 

I was interested in seeing some actual cultural clashes between the characters. You have two Dalish elves and a Tevinter mage, but there’s no real suspicion at any point. Bellara and Neve are just immediate besties. 
You can’t ask Neve questions about her upbringing or opinions on living in a mage supremacy as a lower-class mage. The game just tells you she’s a good person and loves Dock Town. But she’s still a mage from Tevinter. If she has no questionable opinions, why is that? Why does she think like she does when she grew up in a nation like Tevinter? I’d like to know.
Similarly, why are there no discussion on the different varieties of Andrastianism? Outside of Davrin and Bellara, all other companions would have lived under the rule of either the Orlesian or Imperial Chantry (I know Rivain is different, but still). Do they not have any misconceptions or suspicions about the others? Why is everyone so chill about the Qun?
It’s unfortunate that the ability to ask the characters questions outside of cutscenes was removed. I assume the justification would be something about boundaries, but these are not real people. Let me pester them! 

The combat is fun at first, but the limited skill slots hinder it. The companion limit is a horrible choice, as is the fact that they can’t be controlled. They might as well not be there, considering how utterly useless they are in a fight. I spent most fights running away and dodging, so my mage character wouldn’t get body-slammed every five seconds.
The inventory system is horrible. The vendors and the faction “rank ups” break immersion. I understand they’re remnants from the live service version of the game, but damn, such a poor system. 
I didn’t mind the art style. The CC is good, but somehow not as good as in DAI. The clothes and weapons are over-designed, so I’m grateful for the transmog system. 
The scenery is stunning but lifeless, just like in Inquisition. The NPCs are static and don’t react to anything around them. 
The music is so basic that I can only recall one moment (Weisshaupt) where I actually noticed it.

I don’t know. I could write even more, but what’s the point? In the end, I wish the game had been better, and I wish over a decade of being a fan hadn’t been dismissed so brutally. “Rocks fall, everybody dies” is a sad way to say goodbye.

I preface this with the fact that I've played the other Dragon Age games, the Mass Effect ones too. The TL;DR here is that if you liked Mass Effect 2, you'll be okay with this game. Its clumsy in places, but there is a lot of heart here.

Does it bother me that my choices from the prior games are ignored by the game? Yeah, it sure does, but those choices still matters. I still made them. They happened, even if this game doesn't show them. Such is legacy sometimes, there is a lot to record and remember, so many variables. I think they cut too much of the fat, but it's not the first time this series has done this, and anyone who denies it are kidding themselves. Remember when a Dalish warden sacrificed herself and so the clans got the hinterlands as their own? No? Neither do the games, don't worry. 

The game-play is pretty fun, I played on a custom setting to up the enemy damage but keep their HP manageable. I was a Mage, went with the spellblade and found that I could punch above my weight if I was careful. I will ashamedly admit it took me more hours than I'd like to realize that my allies didn't have HP and their support spells were to save my ass when I decide to go punch the level 40 superboss at level 29. (I eventually won, by the way.)

I enjoyed the companions, although I recognize this is a very subjective statement. The companions remind me a lot of my dungeons and dragons games, of the people I play with and the characters they bring to the table. I enjoy the mundane and almost domestic moments of getting to talk, I like the interesting dynamics that play out between them every time I head back to the lighthouse. I know it's not for everyone, but it was good for me.

If you got this far, I'm glad some of my words resonated. For good or ill. This game made a lot of mistakes, but there is a lot of love stitched into every seam. There is a passion here, to tell a story, to finish one chapter and move onto the next. The team had a heavy weight to bear, 15 years of expectation, 10 of anticipation and a name so big it could make or break them...  But, as an old dwarf once said, stories are about change.

I will preface by saying that Dragon Age: Origins is likely my favorite game of all time with few contenders. That being said, I think every entry has something good to offer if you are willing to enjoy each game for what they are rather than what you want them to be. If I had to say where Veilguard ranks among the four games with DA:O being the top in the ""amazing, with flaws"" category, it would be right under Inquisition in the ""decent and fun with big issues"" category, and above ""decent, but I hate it"" category that Dragon Age 2 sits in.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard continues the series tradition following the first game, of ambitiously doing its own thing and failing to live up to its potential. It fully embraces the series shift over the last couple games from a dark fantasy CRPG to a high fantasy action ARPG and I would describe the experience like showing up for Dragon Age and getting Hogwarts: Legacy, which was definitely an unexpected (honestly unwelcome) change in energy and tone for me. There is still some darkness in the game, but it is pretty sanitized and shows up in specific moments before being lampooned by some cringy/witty dialogue (the Disney/Marvel approach). You can't ever really be a bad guy or be mean (every choice has a positive spin) and are firmly the cool Chosen Dude to stop the mainly cartoonishly evil villains from ending the world. Most of the choices you make don't really matter or change much, and the ones that do are often lame choices in my opinion. That all sounds pretty negative on the surface, but I actually think that broadly speaking, the main plot of gathering allies and going on the suicide mission delivers pretty well and the finale was pretty great. Though I don't know how I feel about how things actually resolved and what it will mean for the story going forward (if it does).

There is a lot of solid stuff here - beautiful environments, interesting lore revelations, some good character moments, pretty fun combat, and some cool cinematic moments accompanied by great music which all do the heavy lifting to make this a mediocre, enjoyable experience because there is so much that is... not solid.
The first 5/6 hours of game-play is tough to get through and really shows off the worst of the game, namely: bad line delivery of weird modernized, often unnatural dialogue; a bunch of repetition and rehashing plot-points over and over;  pointless choices that don't really change anything; weird characterization and development for existing franchise characters; and probably more. Quite frankly, a lot of this feels like it was written for a juvenile audience with very little attention span for plot, which is quite irritating given the last few games. This shows up even in how choices are presented to you which really is just ""here is a sum of this side and that side, do what you want, we don't care,"" so nothing feels like it has real weight.
Of course there is good dialogue and good voice performances as well, but that is the minority as most just does the job. Companions are very hit or miss and really wasn't impressed by any of them or their story-lines, but I do appreciate that side quests were tied into the main plot and they do have some influence on events. Whether you choose to do all of the companion missions and strengthen your allies or not influences survival rates in the last missions of the game much like Mass Effect 2 which is about the only thing you can influence in this game.
The combat, while fun, gets annoying and repetitive as the game progresses and enemies get pretty aggressive, as there is often too much happening at once but you will learn to deal with it especially since the game isn't hard (subjective, I know). The fact that pretty much every approach in this game is to fight also makes the 50 or so hours of fighting you have to do get stale. I can think of only one time where I could resolve a situation with talking instead of fighting. 

Overall, I had fun with this game even with all the bad in it. I am not too excited about the direction the series has gone in, but I have felt that way since the second game. If you are looking for a game more like DA:O then we have Baldur's Gate 3 which is more that style.

HOWEVER
It is also not an exemplary RPG and is quite different in terms of tone and style from previous DA games, especially if you're a fan of DA Origins.

It is a decent, higher than average action RPG set in the DA universe. It feels like the sort of junk food that you crave time to time or if you have no other options. If you compare it to other RPG examples, like the recent Metaphor, or last year's BG3, you will not find the same level of depth and character/story interaction as you might find there. Writing here is not the best (you'll find much better examples out there), and sometimes it's downright cringy (but at least not as often as some people say it is).

Gameplay wise, it starts strong and fun... for some time. I'm saying that because at this point I'm already starting to feel a slight burnout and I can also feel some mmo DNA sprinkled throughout (remnants of old scrapped ideas for this title). Some of the bosses are the highlights, but most of the regular enemies get repetitive real quick and the sense of depth to the combat is somewhat false. Yes, you have some options and flexibility, but you end up mashing the same 2 buttons and it just works. Also the game is not very challenging even on high difficulties. So, hopefully it'll get more engaging later, but I doubt it. In the end it's just ok, it works, and it can be fun.
Exploration and puzzles are just meh. I mostly do it to look at the environments and satisfy my game ADHD (I need all the collectibles man)

Music and sound design are decent, but sort of... generic? Even the fact that Hans Zimmer worked on the OST didn't really help, since you can find some of his previous works much more memorable. Voice acting is not bad, especially on some characters, but it often feels bland, almost like there was a problem with direction of the lines. However, I've heard much worse in other titles, so I'm okay with it. 

Hands down the strongest parts of the game are visuals and the overall optimization. In the current age where we constantly get half-baked games that also require you to run at low res, med settings and upscaling + frame gen on to get a somewhat decent performance (looking at you, MH Wilds), this game feels like a dream in that sense. No issues at all and it's always pleasant to look at. And that hair! Some of the best looking hair I've seen in a game to date, great stuff.

Anyway, my overall score is somewhere around 6.5, at high points it's more like a 7.0

I doubt that it'll increase in time since I already can see what the whole deal is about, so my advice - wait for a sale, don't get it for a full price unless you absolutely want to? Your choice. You'll probably still get a good bit of fun out of it. But if you're more focused on the roleplaying aspect, be warned, you might be disappointed. 

If my opinion suddenly changes once I finish the game, I'll return and write an update.

I don't think it's a bad or terrible game, not nearly to the extent that people are saying online. But I also don't think it's a great game either. I think the comparisons to Baldur's Gate 3 is kind of unfair, as I don't think they're exactly comparable, ignoring the fact that BG3 was kind of a lightning in a bottle situation. Veilguard is definitely a product of mismanagement, but not in the way that everyone thinks. I think we're seeing another example of a game that was stuck in development hell for too long, caught onto too many trends that there popular a few years ago and didn't really keep up.

But I also don't think that Dragon Age, as a series, really knows what it wants to be. You can look back through all four installments as evidence of that. Every time, there's new system, completely new combat overhauls, and overthunk and overwrought ways of doing things. Compared to Mass Effect, that series was far more tighter, where each installment simply built upon and refined what was already ther. This didn't happen with Dragon Age, and we're seeing it again. I like to think if Dragon Age 2 released in this year, it would've gotten far more hate now than it did initially, and it did take a lot of heat.

So let's get the big point out of the room right now. The writing. Yes, the writing isn't...great. It's basically servicable with a series of cringe moments and slightly stilted voice acting. This isn't to say it's BAD. Personally, I have a deliniation between what I call 'bad' and what I call 'servicable', and this game does fall more into the latter. There are brief moments, usually the moments where Solas or Varric is involved where the writing is far tighter and that shows during cutscenes. But those moments are not nearly as recognizable. 

This is more endemic to how EA does things, and I think many of us can agree there's a been a notable decline in quality of work ever since EA purchased the company, but it skirted by on that 'BioWare magic', which I'm fair to say died when Anthem came out and had been dying when Inquisition was being made. EA from what I can tell, from what I read going into various writing credits of the writing team involved, makes it clear that EA did not want to pay for compatant writers. A cardinal sin in any story heavy RPG. If one were to check the IMDBs of these people, you'll note that few have decent writing credits under their belt. These people simply weren't experienced enough, largely because I believe the publisher didn't want to pay for quality.

Now, one can make whatever 'DEI' argument they want to make, and really, I'm not here for that. I don't care. I will call the character doing pushups for misgendering as a cringe scene, because it is a cringe scene. But that scene does not damn an entire game. The game runs flawlessly on PC, with no bugs or hiccups and stays far above 60FPS. This is alien in a major title market known for having PC issues on Day One. The sound design and art is very well done and I have to admit, for all it's faults, it's probably the prettiest game I've played all year.

As much as I loathe to admit, I'm having fun with game's combat. Is it Origins? Hell no, it's so far removed from Origins, I struggle to know why one decided to add the Dragon Age label to it. But it's also not the MMO-lite slog that Inquisition was either. Making the statement of being a 'God of War Reboot' clone is partially apt, as I'd say there's enough variety to keep it from being a wholesale ripoff. But the point here is, the combat is fun. And entertaining, and really, I can't really argue for much else.

Basically, all in the all, the game is...fine. It's servicable. It's not GoY material, and anyone that says otherwise is selling something. But I enjoy the game for what it is, warts an all. Largely because I'm an adult and I don't care that trans and NB people exist. Those messages regarding them aren't for me. Could those messages been a little more subtle and written better? Certainly, no lie there. But to imply that's all the game is, is an unfair statement.

The jist is this. If you want to play a game that basically is gonna play out like a young adult TV series. It's popcorn entertainment, if you can unplug your brain long enough. Hell, I might even play through it again, given how things go. But for now? The game is fine. I'd dare to say to good, but the writing probably does hold it back. I'd say play it if you like RPGs, but everyone probably just wait till it's on sale.

As a lighthearted fantasy adventure, Veilguard is immaculate. It's well-optimized, bug-free, DRM-free, microtransaction-free, visuals are gorgeous, combat is engaging (after you go into the difficulty settings and turn down enemy health so they're not such damage sponges), and its accessibility options and quality of life perks (including a transmog/glam system for your outfits!) should be the new gold standard the industry aspires to. On the whole, it feels like no expense was spared to bring the developers' vision to life, and on that merit, I can recommend Veilguard.

But only just barely. Because it's also a Dragon Age game, made by Bioware, that flees from its own pedigree. Veilguard seems absolutely terrified of the possibility that the player might ever be made to feel slightly uncomfortable with its narrative. It will never challenge you to wrestle with difficult moral questions, never put you into direct conflict with your companions, never tempt you to commit lesser evil in the name of greater good, and never force you to engage with complex topics like history, politics, and religion. Just sit back and watch as your family-friendly hero saves the world while miraculously never being made to challenge their ideals or consider compromising their morals. All Dragon Age games are ultimately stories about good triumphing over evil, but past entries demanded you choose what you valued and who you were willing to sacrifice, and forced you to live with the consequences. Veilguard also has choices, but will always insist that you did the best you could and shouldn't think about them too much.

At least until the finale, anyways. Veilguard may be the opposite of Dragon Age 2 in that it has dull writing and excellent production values, but it's also the opposite of Mass Effect 3 in that its ending is so well executed it might very well redeem the tedium of everything that preceded it. No spoilers here, but I can safely say this is some of Bioware's best work to date and easily proves itself the equal of Mass Effect 2's suicide mission or Inquisition's Trespasser.

Ultimately, whether Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a ""good game"" is something only you can decide. I strongly recommend all Dragon Age fans play it at some point, even if you have to wait for a sale. It might not be the game we wanted, or the game we expected, but it does accomplish the one thing we don't want to admit Dragon Age needed: it frees us from the shadow of Origins.

I've never felt so conflicted over a single entry into a series as I do over this one. I only selected the thumbs up recommend option over the thumbs down option because I feel like Dragon Age The Veilguard is a good game overall... just [b] not a good Dragon Age game. [/b]

Pros:
*Beautiful and detailed environments.
*Engaging maps that are interesting to traverse.
*Game rewards player for exploration with meaningful rewards (ex: equipment upgrades, interesting codex entries that expand upon the world).
*Action combat is fun and didn't get boring for me (I completed game on nightmare setting).
*Third Act of the game is great - high action, tight high stakes story-telling, appropriate tone of dialogue for what was happening around the characters.

Cons:
*Dialogue is cringe worthy, shallow, and sets a tone that is in direct opposition to the game world's reality for MOST of the game's duration.
*Companions are OK, not memorable enough to be placed among the echelon of great companions from previous titles.
*Romance in this game is...there? I guess? I wouldn't consider any interaction with your companions REMOTELY romantic...but they give you ""heart"" options in the dialogue wheel if that is your thing...but I have feeling it won't be. 
*The conclusion of selected companion romanced felt shallow and unearned. Romance between companions outside of the player character felt more meaningful as they had much more banter that helped ""grow"" the blossoming relationship. I found myself more interested in helping my companions romance each other than I did in chasing my own romantic interests.
*Almost a complete disregard to the events that occurred in the previous 3 entries in this series. It cheapened the experience overall as player choice was a staple for the Dragon Age games as was bringing in the player's world states from the other titles. I think because this feature was lacking, I felt quite the disconnect from the events unfolding in this game, especially when the Inquisitor shows up.
*Lineage/Race has very shallow reactivity in the game. I played as an Elf and a Qunari. As an elf, other elves continued to over explain elf things to me, even after briefly acknowledging my elfdom. As a Qunari, being in Tevinter especially, I was hoping for more push back from citizens but there was nothing. I guess in the last 10 years between Inquisition and Veilguard, Thedas removed all of its racism. Yay.


Overall Thoughts:
6/10 for me. This is an action game, not a true role playing game. The only role you get to play is the hero. This plays in a style reminiscent of Mass Effect 2 with a Dragon Age skin but worse dialogue/writing. It is still an enjoyable game but I think people who loved Origins and DA:I, will have a hard time with this one.

My issue is that this feels more like a blockbuster Marvel movie, with overly quippy dialogue and no darkness or edge to be found.  Everyone and everything is too positive and happy-go-lucky for what's actually going on around them, and it really degrades the immersion.

I really hope that if they do another, because I would hate to see this franchise do a Fable Dive, they go back to the original humor, push boundaries for darkness, and suffocate us in world lore that actually makes sense. 

The combat is pretty fun! Actually! It does get ""repetitive"" but as someone who has played 10 years of FFXIV what's repetitive? Just hit your buttons man and let's not wipe pulls. I've seen some say the difficulties could be fixed so if you're extreme it might be less to your liking.

As someone who has been playing Dragon Age ever since Origins was released and considers the series as one of his favorites, I feel that Dragon Age: The Veilguard was very much a mixed bag. It is a fun and entertaining game, but busy in their quest for winning the attention of new players, BioWare has not been able to capture the essence of the series very faithfully.

Having just finished the game, I’ll write down the different aspects I liked and disliked while they are still fresh in my memory.

[h2]The Good:[/h2]

1. Veilguard is easily the prettiest Dragon Age game, and that’s not just because it’s the newest and has the most updated graphics. I always felt that Origins was ahead of its time when it came to graphics and Inquisition was also a treat to look at. However, Inquisition had opted to go for a hyper-realistic aesthetic, while Veilguard goes for a very artistic look with gorgeous environments. I personally feel that is much more suitable for a fantasy game.

2. The combat of Veilguard can be hit or miss, but from what I have seen, the majority of players seem to love the fast pace. It can definitely feel more engaging and responsive than previous entries. The difficulty curve is very fair. I personally find it enjoyable enough, though it’s not my favorite. I prefer having an actual quickbar with a number of different abilities and not just be limited to only 3 at a time.

3. Veilguard lacks the kind of simple unimaginative fetch quests that often plague RPGs, which was a problem with Inquisition. Side quests are fewer but they are a lot more fleshed out, and often unlock new areas to explore. The companion and faction quests actually have an impact in the endgame, much like the loyalty quests of Mass Effect 2, and you would probably be penalized for ignoring them.

4. Just like any BioWare game the companions are, for the most part, very well written characters with a surprising amount of depth. From the trailers, I had expected to hate Emmrich but he ended up being one of the most wholesome companions BioWare had ever written. There has been a lot of criticism regarding Taash, but they also grow on you very soon. With their unique personalities and meaningful personal arcs, the companions are probably the most memorable part of the game.

5. The companions had excellent voice acting as well, as did most of the NPCs. Whether it’s Neve’s iconic drawl, Bellara’s fast, energetic speech, Emmrich’s warm, polite, properly enunciated words, or even Taash’s non-committal grunts, each actor really brought their character to life.

6. Since the maps are full of secrets and gathering loot is the main way of acquiring and updating new equipment, the exploration feels very rewarding. If you are a completionist like me, you will probably spend quite a bit of time figuring out hidden ways and puzzles that lead to the next chest, and when you do, it definitely feels worth it.

[h2]The Bad:[/h2]

1. The writing of the game is extremely inconsistent. Some quests, especially those involving companions or factions, do feel very much like the old BioWare magic. Then you come across some dialog that seems like it was written by a teenage fanfiction author, especially during the first half of the game. Some dialog options made no sense. The witty options often sounded less humorous than the serious ones. Sometimes the usage of certain words feels anachronistic. I guess this was to be expected after letting go of your most experienced writers halfway through development.

2. While the animation overall is excellent, I had no idea what was wrong with Rook’s facial expressions. Often, even during serious discussions regarding death or loss, his face would break out in a smile. This was very unnerving.

3. Though BioWare has not actually broken any existing lore, they [i]have[/i] been too liberal with it, which may cheapen the significance of some of the previous events. While the main storyline is more interesting than Inquisition, I feel like they tried to overcompensate with lore dumping and shock value. Veilguard gives you a LOT more information about the world, the Fade, and its history than all three previous games combined, and the worst part is that as players, you don’t find out these secrets organically like the previous games, but through ‘memories’ that you discover. This again seems like poor writing. I could do without a history lesson with a PowerPoint presentation in the middle of my game.

4. Veilguard is the least optimized game BioWare has ever made. Until now their PC releases were excellent. Mass Effect 2, 3, even Dragon Age Inquisition offered a great performance, but even if you exceed the recommended requirements of this game, you would run into FPS drops, stuttering, and graphical glitches, especially in crowded areas.

5. The Dragon Age series was being simplified ever since Origins. DA2 took away talents, Inquisition simplified skill trees and attributes, and Veilguard does away with the illusion entirely. It is now an action-RPG with a lot more focus on the action. You have less active companions, who have been reduced to background characters in combat, and you don’t even need to have a proper party with a tank and healer. BioWare seems to have bought into the myth that people want easier and simpler games, or that players don’t like to think too much. This is factually wrong, and honestly kind of insulting.

6. The lack of references from choices made in previous games was quite disappointing. Regular players would have been satisfied with some passing mentions and a few codex entries. These exist, but since the game doesn’t really import any choices, they feel very generic. What’s worse is that at times the game tries to subtly imply certain previous choices as canon while they continue to claim that a canon does not exist.

7. After the powerful last act, the epilogue was very disappointing. The ending slides just repeat what we already know, with no indication of how those decisions would change things in the world further down the line.

[h2]The Others:[/h2]

1. I felt somewhat disappointed that while the plot of Veilguard deals with an even bigger world ending threat, it doesn’t feel as [i]epic[/i] as Inquisition. This has nothing to do with the maps being linear. Origins itself felt very epic, as did Mass Effect 2 and 3. There is just something inexplicable missing in this game that couldn’t make me care that much about the end of the world. The soundtrack definitely did not help in this regard.

2. I have heard the criticism that Veilguard is not as dark as the previous entries and the game has been ‘Disney-fied’. Both these allegations are false. In many ways, Veilguard is the darkest Dragon Age entry, and you will not come out of it emotionally unscathed.

3. Despite the claims that the game is too ‘woke’ (whatever that means), I have not seen much discussions about gender and sexuality outside  one codex entry and a few personal quests for Taash, which might amount to 10 minutes of dialog in an easily 90 hour game. If that offends you too much, you may need some self-reflection. Thedas has always been a very progressive setting and Veilguard just continues that tradition.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

The Veilguard is a good game. It has a lot of life. But I don’t know if it’s a great Dragon Age game. To me, it’s definitely the weakest in the series in terms of writing, but it is not without its own strengths. Much like the Dread Wolf himself, Veilguard tries to be a rebel, but I don’t know if the rebellion was necessary at all.

Veilguard makes me think that I should adjust my expectations for the future of the series and be ready for more unnecessary simplifications, because some executives somewhere in EA headquarters think that players want to think less and have more flashy action. I guess these are just the times we live in now.

For once, Bioware has made a game that actually plays brilliantly but often lacks in the writing department. Most of the failings in this game can be put down to EA layoffs or 10 years in development hell, to be honest. A good fantasy game, but nowhere near the best Dragon Age game and comes in near the bottom for me (as someone who is very generously patient with the older installments).

Minor dialogue and smaller things in the game are written almost atrociously at times, but I can excuse this for (what I assume is) the work of Trick Weekes and senior writers (every scene with Solas was a really strong idea of what the game could have been, as well as Act 3. [b]Act 3 was truly great, if you manage to get there[/b]). Early in the game has a lot of pacing issues - it's just Thing Happens, Thing Happens, Foreshadowed Unexpected Thing Happens. As well as lack of companion depth from lack of content, which is disappointing from Bioware of all developers. 
[b]Massive miss with the whole 'only 3 choices' option,[/b] especially because they truly don't matter whatsoever. I hope this is because of internal issues and NOT because someone actually thought that was a good idea. 

Combat is stupidly fun and the best thing they've done with this game. Inquisition combat was awful. It does feel like [b]they've listened to what people disliked from Inquisition and made it 100x better.[/b]

Biggest irk is the soundtrack. Only time the music actually impacted me or even felt connected to the game was when a motif from Inquisition would play. Trevor Morris I will avenge you. 

Overall, it is definitely a Dragon Age game and the closest to early in the franchise as you're going to get from Bioware nowadays. Tone is not nearly as 'Disney Pixar' as people make it out to be - although minor dialogue issues contribute to that.

Veilguard pushes the franchise further down the path it's been on since DA2, diverging from the tactical combat and deep storytelling of Dragon Age: Origins in favour of a simpler, more broadly appealing action-RPG formula.
Veilguard is unapologetically action-focused, with limited roleplaying options and narrative choices, and simplified combat and dialogue. Combat is flashy, with exaggerated attack animations and over-the-top high fantasy visuals and effects. While it does boast expansive skill trees for the three classes, RPG elements are overall reduced.
Veilguard returns to a linear, episodic map structure (after Inquisition's open-world forray) which is effective, though some maps feel small, and the platforming elements (jumping around to solve puzzles) don't quite fit.

The writing is the real shortfall of this entry into the series, and a serious break from past titles.
While the visuals try to retain the darkness, grit and gore fans expect from this dark fantasy setting, Veilguard constantly undercuts the atmosphere with shallow, lighthearted storytelling, quippy one-liners and cheesy dialogue. The game ignores huge swathes of the established lore, and feels free to rewrite other parts to suit the current writing team, which will leave long-time fans with a sour taste in the mouth.
It feels intended for a younger audience, leaning HEAVILY on exposition and overly literal dialogue that spells out themes instead of allowing subtext. Dramatic moments are often undercut by moral lectures, sapping scenes of tension and subtlety.
Anachronisms in language - like characters referring to their 'team', enemies as 'bad guys', or yelling warnings about 'snipers' - can pull players out of the medieval fantasy setting. Additionally, while the series' commitment to diversity is a positive, its presentation in Veilguard feels forced and overly pretentious, detracting from the narrative flow.

Is this what I wanted from Dragon Age? Not really. But on its own terms, it succeeds as a highly polished AAA action RPG.
As an action RPG, it's enjoyable and impressively polished, and for that I can recommend it, but for those hoping for the deep, layered roleplaying experience of past Dragon Age titles, Veilguard falls short of the mark.

Ultimately, whether Veilguard is the Dragon Age experience you want is something only you can decide.


Updated thoughts after finishing the game
__________________________________

Dragon Age is dead. Long live Dragon Age!

My first impressions held up after completing the game: it’s a fun, polished action game - which I will be replaying to try the other classes - but it is not a Dragon Age game.
Veilguard feels like a streamlined fantasy action game with a Dragon Age skin, but the depth and emotional resonance characteristic of the series have been lost, and the tone would be more appropriate in a Harry Potter game or a new IP targeted at young adults.

Veilguard uses plenty of Dragon Age lore, but it doesn’t so much build on it as it burns through it for cheap impact, casually answering long-standing mysteries and dispatching major lore threats with little fanfare or reverence. 
The mysteries that made the world of Thedas so compelling—the darkspawn and the blight, the archdemons, the Tevinter magisters, the secrets of the Titans, the history of the ancient elves—all are wrapped up with blunt explanations, effectively closing narrative doors that older games had left open. At this point, the only mystery left is why anyone would care about this world going forward.

Dragon Age as we knew it is dead. This game closes the book on a 15 year old story, and sets the IP up for a clean reset.

The writing is the weakest there and things aren't given a lot of room to breathe in what I believe was an attempt to get the players through those initial quests as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, as fast as possible is still several hours.  I'd forgive anyone who assumed this game wasn't for them within that time period.

However, the writing picks up as soon as you're able to choose which quest to embark on next and, if you follow the game through to the end, you're in for an absolutely incredible ride!  The story is great, the lore stuff is cool, and interacting with companions has never been more satisfying as they all have their own storylines that intertwine with the main one.  Also, the faction stuff plays a much bigger role than I initially assumed it would.

I feel like this one blends the best parts of 2 and Inquisiton.  If you're the type of player who only enjoyed Origins then this one might not be for you.  It certainly doesn't have that crpg feel and you are limited to playing a good guy.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though.  There's always a trade off somewhere.

I'm an old school nerd, and I mean OLD. I played Baldur's Gate - the very first one - by buying it on a CD. When the sequel Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn came I was all over it and replayed it like a dozen times. I wrote fanfiction about the characters on old message bords. When Dragon Age: Origins came out it was for me the New Thing, the Different Thing, but I loved it all the same. It did weird things with the tropes I knew, and I wasn't always crazy about them, but it stuck the landing all the same. I'm saying all this to explain how to me, Dragon Age: Origins isn't where it starts for me, but rather way before that. 

So what's Veilguard like? Well... Playing the Dragon Age games is playing with an indecisive DM who houserules and modifies all the time, be it gameplay, how races look (remember the hornless Qunari), how characters look (remember how DAO Isabella looked) and many other things, so that must at this point be expected. DAO was largely a classic party strategy game with WOW-style bars to scroll up and down to find your abilities. DA2 introduced a faster pace and more arcade-y fighting, DAI tried to mesh the two and it went... so-so. Now Veilguard is here, and once again it's doing its own thing. The fighting reminds me or DA2  - with a bit of Mass Effect of all things blended in. The inventory management is once again a bit more on the arcade-y side as well, and generally I'm getting the sense of ""action-adventure"" more than the ""strategy-lite"" style of for example Pathfinder or once again DAO. 

Yet, do I enjoy it? Having accepted that Dragon Age as a series kinda goes all over the place trying different things? Yes. The combat's a bit halfway between DA2 and DAI, and seems to offer the same ability to combo things into insanity if you know what you're doing that DAI did. The companions are making an impression on me, and while I haven't seen that much of them, they certainly seem more interesting than for example Mass Effect Andromeda's. The world looks great - even if again a bit different - and I already had my first gleeful giggle at the verbal bitchslapping my Rook delivered at one point. All that is making me hopeful, making me feel like the Dragon Age I adore is back. 

Will this last? Who knows?! But at least right now, I'm happy.

EDIT: Sitting here now having complete the game, I can say that overall, it did last. Was it wonky in some places? Was it sometimes a bit stiff? Did it fumble a decent chunk of the previous lore? Do I wish they had actually made use of events in previous games? All yes. But did I have fun? Did I get excited? Did the ending satisfy me? Also yes. I won't begrudge anyone their issues with the game (unless they're the ""weeh weeh woke"" people), but all the same it was a satisfying game all in all.

In general DAV is a good RPG for people with 0 knowledge about the existing lore in the franchise, the game has all the systems you'd come to expect from an RPG, it has a good skill tree, it has good combat design, it looks stunning, has tons of QoL features, tons of customization, it's very well optimized and polished, level design is awesome and precise. It doesn't suffer from open world emptiness and doesn't feel as much of a corridor simulator. Major quest levels are also really really well done and I enjoyed fighting my way through those missions, it's always a spectacle. It's a totally serviceable game if you don't take into account the Dragon Age title.

For existing players I cannot in good faith recommend this title at all. It honestly slaps prior fans in the face with the amount of lore discrepancies, contradiction, poor writing and blatant disrespect of choices in previous games.
It wouldn't be as devastating if at least the new cast of companions and our protagonist was written in a way that didn't scream like they got passed through 60 HR employees. Dialogue is bland, all the depth and morally grey aspects surrounding the lore is just straight up reconned or watered down to the point of bafflement.
You are not allowed to be anything but a ""Yes-man"" to these companions, there is no friction, no deep dynamic between Rook and companions, there is no true and proper bonding as it was the case in previous games. You are treated like a therapist running from room to room solving everyone's problem with a smile on your face. None of the companions except Davrin, Emmerich and Bellara give a single flying fudge about Rook. You interact with them as a narrative tool, not as a balanced dynamic between teammates. There is no comradery, just Rook forcing their way into conversations of the companions, unnecessarily even. It's at times a struggle to read through the dialogue because the writing's shallow and awkward. Rooks best moments are hilariously only present when they're in a dialogue with Solas. Why? Because they're allowed to have a personality for once that goes beyond ""Yes!"" ""Yes. (joke)"" and ""Yes."" they're allowed to disagree, agree, banter, exchange quips with Solas but denied when it's about the companions. Why is that? Why aren't we allowed to challenge them? 
The romance is also a complete joke in this game and feel like an afterthought compared to the advertised ""best romance in all three games"" you have to be kidding me. In the 70h I've been playing, the romance scenes accumulate to maybe 20 minutes. And that is stretching it with a companion that is actually well written (Emmerich). Romancing Harding or Lucanis feels actually painful, because those two suffer the worst case of ""I only care about my own quest and just want you here to act as a meatshield."" not because they have any interest in Rook, despite what the game is trying to gaslight you into believing.

Factions are also mostly useless from a narrative perspective. I still cannot believe how Nevarra doesn't play a bigger role in this game. The ones with the most impact are to no ones surprise the Grey Wardens, followed by the Crows (got butchered) and then the Veil jumpers (meh), to the Mournwatch ( the best faction) and lastly Lords of Fortune (awfully implemented). The last 2 have no significant impact on the story.

The way magic is treated in DAV also reminds more of sci-fi than fantasy, everything is now explained in science terms, ""amplifiers"" ""resonating the XY to the XZ and tweaking the XY to get this fluctuation"" you see that a lot with those magical gadgets. And it really takes me out when in all previous games magic was still treated as a fantasy element, not as a scientific element. And this tonal shift is echoed throughout the entire game, you don't get the sense that DAV plays in Thedas if it weren't for the similar names popping up. Minrathous isn't like the Minrathous explained from previous games. The Crows aren't the same as before, etc. and that is why it's so disappointing as an established fan to go into this game with all of this knowledge just to be let down by questionable writing quality and the blatant attempt at wiping the slate clean. 

Out of the 5 endings, the one considered ""best ending"" is truly the best in terms of satisfaction and payoff because it's the only time the Inquisitor actually plays a role. The other 4 endings are shockingly bad. 

I genuinely hope the writers take the feedback to heart, I love Dragon Age, enjoy all the games with 2 being my favorite despite its shortcomings. Narrative focus was always Bioware's strength, so I don't quite understand what happened here and hope we stop sanitizing the lore for whatever reason and go back to writing compelling characters with proper depth and balance between Protagonist and companion.

Coming from an isometric fan, I much prefer this to the odd blend we have had of genres in the previous two entries. The RPG system of levelling up lets you unlock new combo skills, so it has more depth to it than Inquisition did with its limited skills and passives. Edit: many hours in and the only bugs I have encountered have been clipping issues with some capes, and blighted water flashing in the Anderfells bog.

A lot of reviews I'm seeing seem to be from people that have either skipped all dialogue and cutscenes, or are reviewing in bad faith. My system is by no means top of the range, but its a decent system and i run it fine on the highest settings, no crashes, no bugs so far. I assume the other half of the reviews reporting crashes are not meeting system requirements, because my system is handling this without any issues which is something that cannot be said for some older games on their highest settings. A third camp of reviews are criticising the game's tone - while I partially agree with their sentiment, party members have been cracking jokes at the end of the world in all previous entries with hours of party jokes and banter. It's far from a grim dark setting, have you ever licked a lamp post in winter?

The negatives: Gutted world state continuity. We knew already we wouldnt be able to use Keep to transfer our previous game decisions over. The options are limited to four decisions during character creation (Inquisitor profile, inquisitor romance option, inquisition fate, inquisitors stance on Solas). This felt very lacklustre in my opinion and is a bit of a let down. However, it hasnt effected my positive experience in playing the game so far. Will come back and edit this if that changes. Edit: I think I'm a little past the midway point and there has been no mention of the mage-templar conflict or its resolution, no mention of any acts from origins or DA2 - this is also a let down.

Only other major negative is that some of the dialogue is a little clunky - i disagreed with people on this one during pre release, but I can see where they are coming from at times; but we should be fair on this one, really good dialogue isn't as common as we seem to think it is when criticising things. Still, I've perceived a few lines as clunky enough to distract me for a few moments. Also, the music isnt to my liking so far - was excited for dragon age with Zimmer, but it isnt scratching that nostalgia itch of visiting Thedas for me. Final negative: It doesn't stack up against BG3 so far, which I feel really set the stage for what modern RPGs can achieve. 

Conclusion: I like it so far, its fun. Could it be better? Probably. Was it worth just shy of 60 euros? I'll update my opinion when i finish the game, but so far yes",1730416980,1730675206,True,1212,187,0.6340944766998291,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

The bad- first characters you meet are a little goofy. Its not bad, they're just a bit pixar.  I don't hate them or anything. I have heard from others thats a common opinion but they grow on you.

Only bug I've seen so far is my character's makeup didn't carry in to the game from creation.  Not a big deal as you can change your character at your base. 

 Combat might be a little easy. I'm playing on Nightmare and it feels like this should be the standard difficulty. If I ever want to play again I don't really have anywhere to go up from here. I die a few times on some bosses until I learn their moves but overall not super difficult not punishing as the game seems to save before each boss. No runback or anything,  just try it again.

That being said, I'm finding the combat to be pretty fun. Playing as a rogue if it matters. Lots of dodging out, lunging in to exploit windows.  Overall works pretty good. You can bring up a window to tell your minions... er, friends, what you want them to cast and there are combo spells. If you've played any of the Souls games or Elden ring or other ARPGs I'd recommend starting on the hardest difficulty to get the most out of combat though.

Story is kind of generic but it's not bad. There's baddies that got released and you need to stop them. Not unique but that's alright.  They've definitely move back from DA: Origins feeling like an RPG to more of a combat oriented ARPG game, so expect that. If you come at it without expectations it works pretty well though.

Is it the best Dragon Age game? No

The game is definitely not as bad as people are making it out to be. However, as a huge Dragon Age fan, it is impossible not to compare to previous games. There are both pros and cons. 

The writing is unfortunately the worst in a Dragon Age game. It's not horrible, but it's not good. There are also strong points, especially near the end of the main storyline.

The bloat of Inquisition is gone, in favor of few and better quests that don't take too long to complete, which is a win in my book. Exploration is also tight and fun, unlike the huge empty maps of Inquisition. Overall I definitely prefer this map and quest setup. 

Companions are likeable like every dragon age game. Do they top favorites such as Dorian or Alistair? Of course not. But they're fine. 

Romances so far have been a huge letdown. I romanced Davrin my first playthrough and I thought 'wow, that's very little content'. Now on my second playthrough romancing Lucanis and apparently, it can get worse. When there IS romance content, it's good. However, there is just so LITTLE of it compared to previous Dragon Age games. It's really a huge disappointment. I hear Emmrich is pretty much the only one who has proper romance content (why they did not give everyone an equal amount of scenes is also frustrating), and I regret not romancing him from the getgo to get the best experience. 

Another thing I don't like, and this is coming from a NB person, is the very modern terms and dialogue. In past dragon age games you had characters like Dorian and Krem, but they didn't say the terms 'trans' and 'gay'. It was still very clear what they were, and not saying it did not hurt their storyline. Suddenly hearing dragon age characters say 'trans' and 'nonbinary' throws me off. I wish they presented it like Dorian in inquisition. 

There is also no way to be evil in this game, something I reserve for second playthroughs. There is simply no dialogue option that is even remotely rude or evil. You are always a set nice character. It hurts replayability. Yes there are certain choices that change big things in the game, but the majority of the game will still be playing as the same character as your previous playthrough. A shame. 

Combat is the best that Dragon Age games have ever had. Thinking of going back to Inquisiton with the combat it has makes me miss DATV's combat already. But you don't play Dragon Age for the combat anyway. 

Overall, it was a good time. I don't see myself playing it as much as previous dragon age games. There's just not much reason to. I am planning 3 playthroughs to play as all classes, play as the romances I want, do all endings, and that's it. The different factions and races don't provide enough content to excuse more playthroughs. But still, I repeat, it is not as bad as people are making it out to be, especially people that have not touched the game in the first place.

Edit: Oh, also want to add, that despite the game looking wonderful and running great, I get random crashes that say that my 3060 was 'physically removed'. I've seen other players having this error.

Story seems okish so far. Some writing / dialouge is kinda' bad but it's not horrible and some of it is good. I am curious about where the story goes and what choices I will have to make. There's already been quite a few after only 5 hours. 

Combat is really great. Fluid and flashy. I really think they nailed it and it's a huge step-up from DA:I that tried to be more action-like.

Maps are not open but have enough exploration that you do need to look around and find loot. Itemization is a standard aRPG/MMO formula with rarity, stats and stuff. Nothing special but it looks ok so far. I assume there will be unique / legendary loot later on.

Companions are good (so far as I only have 3) and even the one many seem to be annoyed by I don't mind. 

For now it's probably a 7 or 8. Might go up or down but I really recommend it if you're into RPGs with actionlike combat.

The plot writing was excellent, and the dialogue was not.

I nearly uninstalled and refunded the game in the first 5 hours due to the terribly paced tutorial and ""tell, don't show"" problem.

There was a moment in the first 5 hours where you go to a town which has recently been destroyed, and the art direction speaks volumes: fresh fruit overturned on the ground, not a soul in sight - it had striking, moving atmosphere and just as I was trying to take it in and look around, my companions behind me started shouting, more or less, THIS VILLAGE WAS A GOOD PLACE BUT NOW IT'S BAD. SOMETHING VERY RECENT HAPPENED TO MAKE IT BAD. Yes. I know. I have eyes. I would much rather have had them simply hiss in reaction to the disturbing sight - be affected by it to contribute to the atmosphere - than tell me word for word what I am supposed to take from the scene as a viewer. 

This problem mostly goes away further into the game.

[h2] The Writing [/h2]
The writing is STRUCTURALLY very good. The main quests are incredibly well paced, no side quest feels superfluous. Companion quests are relevant to them, to their (very interesting) faction, and to their personal development. The choices you make during their quests feel significant. Environments were varied and stunning, and there were plenty of quality of life touches like making it clear when a choice has a major effect, like locking in a romance or changing the world state. Choices about the plot matter a lot. This is fundamental, so I am glad they nailed it.

The game is at its best when it takes itself seriously. There were moments in the game where I felt like I was reliving some of the deep, intense moments from Origins, only fresh, and ten times more beautiful. Combined with [b]the combat system,[/b] I truly felt like a skilled battle archer taking down some of the harder enemies with quick timing and well-aimed headshots. 

[h2] Dialogue [/h2]
The dialogue from your protagonist, Rook, is abysmal. I wish my own protagonist were unable to speak. They have the air of a coworker who thinks they are funny. It was painful. The ""hardass"" option is the only one which half-reliably avoids making a poorly timed joke, and it isn't really hardass, it's just directly moving the conversation forward.

The dialogue from companions, while only sometimes cringeworthy, lacks emotional depth. There are moments which should, structurally, have emotional depth, but the characters struggles were never consequential, or have significant interpersonal conflict. Conflicts were resolved too easily, people agreed with compromise too readily. Lucanis never acted like a man who was tortured, for example, and Spite was too easily appeased. Bellara never fails at something from overworking or lashes out in grief. They expressed an emotion, they talk it out, it's resolved. It's too clean. It lacks gravitas.

The dialogue strikes me as a third draft - the kind of lines you put in when writing as a sufficient placeholder to move the scene along with the intention of going back over it later to add subtext. As-is the writing serves its structural purpose, with characters saying what needs to be said to continue, but not generally in a unique voice which obscures or complicates the basic conveyance of facts through their personality, background, or current feelings.

It strikes me as wise to drop this ball if you run out of time. All the supporting layers of writing that need to happen before polishing the dialogue are strong. But so much of the feeling of a game is carried in the character's voices, so it's unfortunate that it ended up feeling half-baked.

The very talented voice actors do a lot with a little.

[h2] Group Cohesion [/h2]
This game has much stronger group cohesion than Inquisition, and it's clear they made a point to cultivate it. It works. I appreciate that the efforts you take throughout the plot which focus on mending and repairing cultures, people, and places culminate in your ability to focus on repair and forward progress in the ending. The plot demonstrates the theme this way, through every quest cumulatively.

Despite this, it felt like an after school special at times. It veers into therapy speak, which took me out of the setting. The world itself was sanitized this way, too - Tevinter doesn't seem to have slaves anywhere? The Crows are all friendly batman vigilantes and not people who traffic children from brothels and torture them as training? At least the blight is still horrible. And characters other than Rook pull out their occasional marvel movie quips as well, undermining the tone and sounding unpleasantly like chatGPT.

[h2] Romance [/h2]
The romances don't seem to add much. An extra line or two of dialogue, and a scene near the end of the game. I wish it resonated more than it did. The protagonist was a big problem here, where tone is so crucial. The intimacy didn't hit because it didn't feel earned, and I could not avoid my Rook having the personality of a goofball camp counselor. If I clicked the ""I like messes"" button, I should have to tie my love interest up like he's Bhaalspawn.

[h2] Overall [/h2]
At the end of the day, the gameplay, plot structure, and art carried it enough that it was something I looked forward to sitting down with for a few hours every day. They did some series-long plot points real justice, and the only flaw is the inconsistency of tone. The dialogue is so bad it hurt, but I think it's worth enduring. It's too much to hope Bioware puts this back in the oven and releases a big patch that redoes all the dialogue, but if they did, it would be a nearly perfect game.",1732007127,1733465417,True,120,29,0.6018319725990295,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

I like many others would have liked to have had more development between Rook and their companions, and some storylines felt a little clunky, but overall I thought it was a solid game and certainly (at least for me!) it wasn't the worst Dragon Age game, even if it wasn't the best either. 

Every time a new DA game comes out there is a barrage of hate against it. When DA 2 came out people complained about the repetitive dungeons and found Hawke's personality grating. When DAI came out the Inquisitor and story was boring - each new game has been critiqued and compared to the one before it and then has somehow become the standard. Even if Origins was remastered people would still have something to complain about!

Veilguard is not without it's disappointments, and I'd love to see some of these addressed in a patch or two if possible, but it did have some great quests, particularly in the main storyline - Weisshaupt was very fun, and I found Act 3 in general very engaging. The final quest is probably one of my favourites of all time. The VA's did a stellar job, combat was fun, and the graphics are stunning. I enjoyed the different maps and I liked that each companion really had their own role - it wasn't just down to Rook - and there were real stakes at play. My next run will be as a mage with an orb and dagger - super fun!

I went slow to make the experience last longer, I enjoyed the flexibility of combat customization, I cried harder than I have in a long time during the scene in the Prison of Regrets (iykyk) and I am already planning my second playthrough (Grey Warden not afraid to make the tough choices) even though I rarely ever actually finish my replays on games, no matter how much I love them.

That said... As much as the beginning of the game made me go, ""omg this is it, it's actually Dragon Age, after all this time!"", I can't say the feeling lasted the whole way through. It's clear how much the game suffered in terms of development from all the people who were laid off, and the many who decided to quit the studio. Veilguard feels like it wants to be an introductory game for new players just approaching Dragon Age as a series while trying to appeal to old diehard fans. Instead what it does is deliver some pretty flat companions without a lot of actual development (especially compared to previous games), a lot of world-tilting lore drops that don't actually change anything, underwhelming romances, and very little roleplay.

I wasn't expecting Rook to be as influential to the world as the Hero of Ferelden or Inquisitor are. I always expected DAV to be more like DA2, where the game isn't about a big organization like the Wardens or the Inquisition, but about a person finding themselves knee-deep in shit and having to deal with things. But with Hawke, even with the repetitive maps and fights, and the very limited environments (given it all takes place in Kirkwall), you get a ton of zest and flavor! Hawke actually feels like someone with a personality rather than just a ""one size fits all"" good protagonist like Rook.

It barely felt like an RPG and more like many other streamlined games like Assassin's Creed or BioShock - which doesn't make it bad, unless you're expecting the level of depth Dragon Age was famous for. Even as someone who always strives to reach the ""best ending"" in DA games, it was annoying that the only person you can actually be mean to is Solas.

I still recommend it. It's a good game, if not a good *Dragon Age* game, but I hope the execs (and whoever they'll put in place of the people who actually created this world and its compelling story and characters) at least listen to constructive criticism. I feel like they were told to focus on the critiques about the combat and the character creator from the previous games and spent ten years perfecting those aspect, forgetting to put meat on the plate.

The performance is fantastic, hats off to Bioware for how optimized and how good of a PC version they did up for this game. Many modern AAA games have a average or poor PC version and not much effort put into it. This one though you can tell they put effort into the PC version to really take advantage of the better hardware people have.

As for the game itself it is good fun so far for me. The combat is improved from Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age Inquisition (Origins still has my favorite combat as someone who is more into crpgs and turn based or realtime with pause combat), the controls are well done and its just fun to explore this world they have created.

The writing of the characters is good, but the overall story so far is not all that amazing like Origins story was but its not terrible story. So far the story is about on par with Dragon Age 2 for me. The dialogue though is terrible, especially with the characters banter. After the first 90 minutes or so the game starts improving alot, get out in the forest and get a few level ups and new gear for you and your companions and it really starts to get enjoyable. Def gets better each hour you are playing.

I need more time with the game to see how good it is once you beat the game, but so far the good outweigh the bad by a good amount so far. Yes I would like a Dragon Age game more akin to Dragon Age Origins, especially for the combat and overall story, but this game still has alot of things going for it. The combat is a good deal more enjoyable than Dragon Age 2 and inquisition, the controls are better and I am liking how they crafted the game world in this game compared to the previous two DA games.

At the moment though it is the Best Bioware game since Mass Effect 3 for me, its a good deal better than Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem. And while not quite as good as DA Origins, so far this is better than DA2 and DA Inquisition for me.

Again, this is coming from someone who likes more hardcore rpgs like Neverwinter Nights 2, Pillars of Eternity 2, Dragon Age Origins, Wasteland 3, Baldurs Gate 3,etc.. So take it for what it is, just the opinion from one guy who loves crpgs the most out of the RPG genre but who also likes to try more action oriented rpgs to. The biggest issue as a big crpg fan though is the writing of the dialogue it is very cringe.

It is great to have Dragon Age back and also have Bioware back, while not perfect it is a huge step up from there past 2 games and even a slight improvement from the last 2 DA games. And while Origins still holds the crown for this series for me, this game would be my second favorite in the series overall (It might not have the story of Origins or 2, but it has better combat, better gameworld and is more fun than 2 and Inquisition).

And lastly I really must say it again but this is a really really good PC version. I am playing at 100fps with the graphics cranked and have not had any big performance dips or any crashes at all, hats off to the people at Bioware who made this PC version shine like it does!

The only negatives I have is that the art design could be better, its not terrible but its not 100% to my liking, the cities could have more people to interact with and the Main Issue is that the dialogue terrible, especially the character banter. I am loving everything else about this game. After a little bit of a slow start the first hour or hour and half the game gets alot better as it goes along. It is a shame that the dialogue is so bad because most of the rest of the game is very good, but the very poor dialogue does bring the game down for me a good deal.

The game also plays well on the Steam Deck to, I just played 3 hours on the Steam Deck while watching the football game (I was in offline mode and away from the internet so the time didn't count). I played it capped at 40fps and it looked good enough and ran well. Runs fantastic on desktop and good enough on Steam Deck, well done devs. I have played now 5 hours on Desktop and 3 hours on Steam Deck.

Lastly, as far as the whole ""The Game is WOKE!"" talk going on at the moment? The game is not woke imo. There was ONE time where I was asked if I wanted Trans options for dialogue, I said no and that was the end of that. It hasn't come up at all in the other 13 hours I have played the game. If someone else wants to have those dialogue options that is fine by me, it doesn't bother me personally at all. I answered no and the game left it at that. It was not thrown in my face all the time.

It is good, but not great, I would give it a 8/10 so far after 21 hours. While not nearly as great as Origins, I still am enjoying it more than I did DA2 or Inquisition.

Positives:
- The combat is great, despite me liking Turnbased & Real time with Pause more in rppgs. The combat just feels good, if you are going to go arcadey, this is better arcade style combat than Inquisition was
- The graphics are fantastic, everywhere you look there are some really gorgeous views
- Game world is well crafted, not overly open world, but not to small either, its a nice mix of linear and some more open spaces
- Overall story is not to bad, its not great like it was in Origins or DA2, but the overall story is slightly better than Inuqistion's story
- Characters, overall I liked many of the characters, the characters themselves are great, I just wish they where given better dialogue
- Customization is fantastic, the character creator at the start of the game is one of the best around imo. You can craft really cool looking characters if you take your time
- Soundtrack is stellar
- PC Version is very well done, I averaged around 90-100 fps the whole game, with most settings cranked and one of the 2 Ray Tracing things turned on (With DLSS and Frame Gen)
- Controls are very well done on both Controller and Keyboard & Mouse


Negatives:
1. The horrible dialogue, especially companion banter, biggest issue in this game by far
2. Cities at times feel a little empty, I would have liked to be able to talk with more people
3. Art Design at times is bad and other times its good, so this is a small issue for me
4. The Tone from Origins (or DA2) is not there in this game at all, it was missing in Inquisition to, but it is missing again here in Veilguard to, would have liked a more mature tone to the game overall.

Score = 7.5 or 8/10... Good, but not great. Better than Inquisition and Dragon Age 2 in many areas, but not anywhere near as epic as Origins was imo. Origins is still the king, 10/10. It is not a 10/10 as some critics said, but it is also not a 3/10 as some people who have not even tried the game have said. It is a mixed bag, some elements are very good, while others not very good at all such as the dialogue.

How is it compared to other Bioware games? Not as good as Dragon Age Origins, Jade Empire, Baldurs gate 1, KOTOR 1, ME 1/2 or DA 2. But for me this is a better game than Anthem, DA: Inquisition and Mass Effect: Andromeda.

***Just beat the game, the last handful of quests where good fun, the game got gradually better as it went along. Was good but not great. No it is not Dragon Age Origins, Baldurs Gate 3, Elden Ring, Fallout new Vegas, Wasteland 3, Gothic 2, KOTOR2 or Pillars Of Eternity 2 type of classic rpg, but it was still a fun action rpg and imo better than the last two DA games. Origins is still king of this series by a good amount, but Veilguard turned out better than I expected. Took me 45 hours, steam didn't record my 3 hours on Steam Deck when I was away from the internet***

DAV (I refuse to say DATV) is a game that somehow survived most horrible choices and years of dev hell to be a completely bug-free, streamlined and reasonably good game on average, both flat and disappointing in some parts but terrific in others. Especially after going through the artwork book, knowing what we've lost from project Joplin and seeing what nightmare the actual DAV was going to be redesigned into, I find the result nothing short of a miracle. 


Now, for the long version... 
(and still spoiler-free)

[h3]the GOOD:[/h3]
- What lore threads were concluded in DAV are pretty great. Surprisingly, the whole Solas, Evanuris and lyrium business. 

- Many of the environments are breath-taking, from Nevarra's Necropolis to late-game Minrathous.

- The mid-game Weisshaupt mission and the last two story missions are nothing short of great, immersive and with fun boss fights. The ending mission in particular easily trumps BG3's buggy and unsatisfying conclusion. Just 9.5/10 on those.

- Music and boss design is also great.

- Combat, at least after playing a Spellblade mage, is great and versatile and surprisingly deep; respecs are free and easy, and items come with pretty new and interesting features. This comes after a trilogy of clunky, spammy and weirdly clunky again combat gameplays. Wouldn't have minded a couple more available abilities, and a way to save a current skill tree profile, but eh. The whole companion business is... odd, and gamey, but it surprisingly works well.

- The game, as mentioned, was essentially bug-free, which is completely unexpected especially for me, a notorious bug-magnet, and has excellent QOL features.

- Hair looks and physics are the best I've ever seen in any game. Pity they didn't add more haircuts and variations while they were adding stupid stuff like poodle cuts. 

- Some companions pleasantly surprised me (Davrin, Bellara, Emmrich), although there's more to them all and not all good.



[h3]the IFFY:[/h3]
- The advertised character customization is a bit odd. For all the buttons and scalars and stuff, I found it impossible to replicate my Inquisitor and real people I actually know. Also, you need to cherry pick your skin complexions because some just look horrid (see later). Some parts are genius, like hair physics and tattoo management, while others were just insufficient.

- Companions and their dialogues are hard to describe. They have very nice parts, while others feel... too streamlined and lacking in zest. Some companion quests left me with a distinct ""yes and?"" feeling. Romances feel like an afterthought, and some I'm told are downright bad, though I'm personally happy they did away with the cringe sex scenes.

- For example, the much rage-baited Taash was better than I expected, but the famous NB dialogue, even in-context, was IMO still badly-written and ham-fisted in (even for a teenager-mind-shaped character). It kinda ended up poisoning and dominating a good personal story with huge potential and a good message, and all it could have taken was a more fitting rewrite with the same exact meaning.

- In typical Bioware fashion, fashion can be either fantastic or horrible in an immersive way that nobody would seriously wear.

- I can personally understand that oh so many threads from the past games were severed or ignored. Honestly, I can't imagine the 5d chess of having to deal with so many player choices and variables. Though, of course, some glaring omissions are still a pain and could honestly have been handled.



[h3]the BAD:[/h3]
- The character art style: victim of dev hell and what I can only imagine as shiv-fights between artists and their managers (vis à vis concept art from the book), it's pretty wildly inconsistent. It's as if someone shouldered in during the last year and tried to salvage and redo what they could, but some characters still look like they came out of a PlayStation3. I'm looking at you, Illario.

- Specific mention of how awful non-Antaam (hostile NPC) Qunari look because of that restyling.

- Many returning characters from past games gravitate around a ""presence token"" tier, even with the very well-written mails by the Inqui offering excellent context (afaik added pretty much in post-production). Not to mention badly-dressed, seriously wtf Morrigan and Inqui. 

- Some setting features were heavily whitewashed. One or two mentions of the huge problem of slavery in Tevinter, one or two mentions of racism against Elves, both long-standing issues in the world that you pretty much SEE nothing of. The huge network of Solas-aligned Elves that destabilized everything during and after Trespasser? Must have imagined it. 

- Cut content. Rivain just reeks of it, and I'm big time angry about Kal-Sharok being dangled in front of us with nothing being done with it. Sure, everybody expects it after all that dev hell, but it doesn't make that any more appetizing.



In conclusion, this is a game that by all rights I expected to crash and burn, and probably would have if the post-Joplin management was allowed to continue what they were perpetrating, and instead even managed to pull ""this is so fucking awesome"" moments. I don't regret throwing 40€ at it, but I do grieve for what it could have been.

I loved inquisition, and Origins is one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time- that said, if you were to compare origins and veilguard, you might think that these were two separate series, with some similar themes and concepts. 

However, if you played them all, you see the throughline. Dragon age has become brighter and more vibrant as time has gone on- the art direction is merely a continuation of the path they've been on. I guess I got over this change of direction as of the second one with its attempt at being action focused, because right now, veilguard is hitting just fine. When I got to the town where the blight hit, I was noticing all of the classic horror elements in origins cranked up to 11. The bodies, the way the blight absorbs- it felt practically cronenberg. If you're actually looking at the level design, you'll notice that it might be colorful, but the ultraviolence is still there; just not in your face. The dialogue writing itself is cartoonish at times, but it really depends on what options you pick and frankly, watching the character interactions outside of yourself is charming and feels dynamic in the way the bonds grow- I can't track how they're developing and I like that. It doesn't feel as complex as BG3, but it does feel connected. I feel like this is also the first Dragon Age game that seems to be showcasing its factions and set pieces in an efficient way- not one where you get lost in the world, but one where you actually get a complete picture of the powers in play. It may not be subtle, but it is effective story telling as far as accessibility goes.

Combat feels very good. I can see why people might say it could get repetitive, but its clear to me that the rpg elements are in the builds and combinations rather than a huge diversity in abilities- kind of like D4, but in a less obnoxious broken way. Frankly, zipping around the battlefield as a spellsword feels really, really, good. I'm curious to see what kind of character combinations you can put together as time goes on, because the game scratches the itch just right when you pull out a good combo attack with your allies. The character design is -fine- but then again, after origins I've never really been a fan of Dragon Age's designs. What was surprisingly good for me is the way it builds on itself. It feels linear at first, but gradually opens up- almost like it was answering my concerns as they grew.

Inquisition wasn't improved by having huge levels with fuck all to do in them. 

The story told here is ultimately quite rewarding for series fans, though it is hurt by poor pacing. It takes ages for you to really see the big picture and care about it, and even then I would assume it's hard for new comers to really care too much. That is maybe Veilguards biggest weakness.

The reception of it is beyond unhinged so apologies for my bitterness about that, I do reflect on the game itself too, and it's long [b](tl;dr at the end, main points are bold)[/b]:

It's incredibly [b]well-polished[/b] and maintains consistent quality from start to finish. Aside from crashes related to Nvidia that got patched early on, there are no notable bugs that can fuel the ragebait trains on YouTube. Graphical performance is also stunning, runs really well on every platform it's on - which is huge after DAI's performance suffered due to old gen consoles holding it back, and eventually even having to stop supporting them before all DLCs were out. The hair tech itself, so long as you can turn it on, is worth literal gold to me.

In previous games, the story's quality and robustness was often front-loaded per dev reflections, leaving parts or the end of the game extremely half-baked. [b]This story clearly had the writers' full attention from start to finish, and it's lovely with lots of emotional highs and lows and unforeseen, but logical twists.[/b] I don't care about people saying the writing is weak, I heavily disagree but they have a right to their opinion. But people saying this is *worse* than the previous games' writing are objectively wrong and will end up in a future collage showing how with every release, people keep saying the same nonsense. People really need to get a grip on their nostalgic rose tinted glasses. Like, do I need to remind everyone of ""swooping is bad"" again? Because people don't get to call a story with warmth to balance the darker parts ""Marvel writing"" while not acknowledging how Gaider's (previous lead writer) writing especially in DAO is a fanboyish homage to Joss Whedon.

The [b]gameplay is definitely the biggest departure from the rest of the series. I find it extremely fun[/b] and for the first time I seek challenges to extend fights, not to skip them. There are definitely some things I wish were differently done, but overall I see why Darrah (previous director, now consultant) said this is the first time DA combat felt fun, not something to simply find acceptable or tolerable. It's completely fair if it's not for people who preferred the older styles. Fortunately we're having a banquet of RPGs these past few years, as one of Larian's devs have put it, so we're not starving for alternatives. Regardless though, Bioware couldn't keep trying to have RTwP combat and make it feel slow and deliberate, but also inject action and quicker decision making into the gameplay. Sooner or later they had to make a choice, if they didn't want people to keep saying ""who plays DA for its mid combat anyway"". The choice wasn't to everyone's taste, and that's okay, not every game has to cater to everyone. It's also okay to civilly mourn the feeling of being left out because of this.

Naturally, there are people who have communicated that the aesthetics and stylization are not to their tastes like rational human beings. But some people are literally insane. How are people going to nut over Arcane and Spiderverse for years, and then see the [b]painterly textures and expressive character designs[/b] and say it's Disneypixarfortniteetc. Especially when we see so much gore and brutality and people getting crushed to death. Get a grip. And any claims about not being able to make good looking characters? Self-reporting on skill issue, simple as.

Out of all the major categories for a game, [b]soundtrack is the one I'm least impressed with.[/b] I wouldn't want Inon Zur back himself for Reasons™️, but DAO and DA2 were definitely much better in terms of a fantastical, enchanting atmosphere, at least for narrative soundtracks - combat soundtrack was the brassiest orchestra that ever brassed. Trevor Morris' work was fairly plain, with some enjoyable pieces that unfortunately overstayed their welcome for me. But now we have the big men Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe themselves! So the soundtrack is even more mid and not at all memorable now. With each game becoming grander and more successful, the soundtrack becomes more and more generic. Truly the definition of suffering from success.

[b]Overall, DAV is probably the first time DA has really found its identity.[/b] This is something devs old and new, Bioware and non-Bioware alike agreed on. While Gaider had his own unique ideas, the series itself very much started as a generic fantasy to make it as marketable as possible. The title ""Dragon Age"" was mashed together because those two words were the most popular-in-marketing words of the era. Dragons were only added to suit the title. Darkspawn were only added because leadership wanted an orc-like race that the player could play indiscriminately. Magic was originally much more restricted narratively, but players would obviously want to throw around fireballs, so the related lore became more lax. This is the first time they had a strong vision for every element of the game, the first time they really respected the writers' vision too, the first time they had full time for development, the first time they didn't crunch and had high morale - and it shows.

Unfortunately, since [b]this is a game about themes of compassion, kindness, and solidarity in the face of imperialism, fascism, historical colonialism, and the devastating consequences of all that[/b], 2024 isn't exactly the best year for its release. In a saner world it would be sweeping nominations if not outright awards. Instead, we have people complaining about how the game is sanitized because ""people are too nice to each other too soon"". You mean to tell me you're not nice to strangers? That you don't try to understand others and work out frictions when they happen? Can you only play games where you can be exclusively the worst person ever? Because let me tell you, there are innumerable games out there where you can be the worst, and outright reward you for it. Let people have just *one* game where they can live the power fantasy of being radically kind and helping people in real and meaningful ways. Just because our companions are not tearing each other apart for the 4th game, and we can't eradicate yet another Dalish clan casually for no reason, you'll live, I promise. (Not even gonna dignify the people complaining about boobs being too small because woke with a detailed response. Touch grass.)

To the people establishing themselves as authority over what is and isn't a ""Dragon Age game"": enjoy the game for what it is, not what it isn't. And stop with the ""I've been a fan since..."" it's obnoxious and meaningless. I've been deep into the fandom for over 10 years now, following lore updates, dev interviews; put thousands of hours collectively into all DA games with 2k being in DAI alone, and had dozens of playthroughs in DAO and DA2 while still in high school; I literally got married to someone I met in the fandom - suffice to say I'm deeply invested in the series too and from *my* perspective, this is the best and most DA game to date. And this take has just as much weight as other people's ""but I'm a real fan"" takes. I'm not any more or less of an arbiter of what makes a true DA game than other fans - who btw in my experience, typically just played DAO on release, and have been complaining about every other DA game ever since. And if someone like that read this far, please know that you can find other hobbies too. You don't have to define yourself as a fan and lover of DA just because you loved one game. You don't have to stay miserable.

My humble thanks if you read all the way and found value in my words, this was admittedly as much a vent as my thoughts on the game itself. Otherwise, [b]tl;dr: the game is good, and I encourage you to play it and enjoy it for what it is, not what it isn't or what people think it should be to be a valid DA game.[/b]",1730471733,1732883875,True,4,0,0.5849056243896484,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

Dragon Age: Veilguard is a mixed bag. On one hand, the game looks and plays great, scenery and lighting are fantastic and the game is definitely optimized when it comes to performance. The combat is flashy and fun, albeit a bit easy if you know what you are doing.

When it comes to the characters and the story however, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The first and last acts of the game are good, but the middle act feels padded and drawn out, it's probably what caused me to take breaks and not play the game for up  to a week at a time.

All in all, it's a pretty fun game if you are willing to push through the boring parts and willing to be condescendingly lectured to by the writing team about a certain companion's identity.

I also really enjoy the companion development through dialogue during campaigns.

The art outside of characters themselves is great, not a fan of the pixar direction on characters, but environments and spell effects are pretty. The set pieces are worthy of just standing a minute and taking in. 

Plenty of dialogue options for class/ race/ and origins are available. First 12 hours of the game and more reactivity than in any owlcat game I've played already. Only larian rivaling the reactivity here. There's even unique dialogue for an elf that has tattoos, just an example the level of reactivity.

it's not a bad game, most of the writing is fine, the tone is fine half the time
it's just a little inconsistent i think, there are times where it feels like dragon age and times it feels like it's trying to be a movie and that's not really the identity of the series so i don't love it

game looks good, character creator is fun, cool that people have more options when making their characters (body size, better dark skin options, pronouns/identity) kinda weird people are mad at it, it's optional but whatever
as a trans woman it is a little jarring to just hear some modern gender/sexuality terminology thrown out in a fantasy game, but it's not like a bad thing, there have been queer characters since the series started so it's disingenuous to pretend this some new attack on something

some of the characters are a lil cringe at times but i dunno.. i feel like people are greatly exaggerating a lot of their feelings bc they have some sort of agenda against not every companion being some fantasy trope copy paste

i do wish there was more conflict within the group, people can only be mad at rook
there's not a lot of moral decisions, there's some hard decisions but like... none of them are morally challenging
would be interesting to take some of those tough decisions and add morally dubious solutions that have better results for you and the war effort but involve some sort of evil stuff idk! 

i'm not a reviewer just rambling. overall, game fun. sometimes it's a lil cringe but people are cringe sometimes so whatever. wish there were more meaningful moral decisions rather than ""does A get hurt or B get hurt""
combat feels good once you get some skill points in, though it feels like some skills should just be part of the base moveset of weapons

Sebenernya kalau di compare secara langsung dengan Dragon's Dogma yang baru masih ga apple to apple rasanya karena sistem partynya sangat berbeda, disini ada beberapa signature skill dari party yang harus kita aktifin secara manual dibandingkan dengan sistem skill dari DD2, tapi tetep sebuah combat yang cukup menghibur. Untuk variasi musuhnya, kayaknya masih menjadi sebuah hal yang kurang sama seperti DD2 tipe musuhnya masih sangat repetitif dan berujung boring, kalau untuk nikmatin story dan adventurenya saya rekomendasikan Normal difficulty aja karena yang jadi faktor pembeda cuman sponge HP aja dari monsternya, dan juga cuman nambah nambahin kerjaan jadi harus ngehit banyak button dalam durasi yang cukup lama.

Untuk dari storynya ini sangat undercook banget, sampah lebih tepatnya untuk franchise Dragon Age. Bener bener kaya cuman nonton dongeng disney dari anak SD, your choice did not even matter karena tidak akan mengubah jalan ceritanya secara major, memang masih ada gimmick dari choice matternya, tapi efeknya cuman siapa nanti companion yang memar permanen, atau siapa yang ngambek karena ga diturutin tp ujung2nya mereka balik lg available di party. Ini tuh lebih kaya cerita yang kita ini MC dan pasti bisa mengalahkan kejahatan, meh banget.

Gimmick RPG nya lebih condong ke arah MMORPG dengan konsep UI, Equipment, Enchanment dll nya malah seperti gim RPG gacha banget. TAPI untuk masalah VISUALNYA ini adalah salah satu yang masih bikin comfortable untuk bermain. Udah, itu aja.

Gimana ya, mungkin untuk saya yang beranjak dari BG3 kemudian mencari game RPG story rich agak sedikit kecewa dengan beberapa aspek dalam gim ini, tapi untuk yang masih bikin betah main sebenernya dari segi GRAFIK VISUAL dan COMBATnya saja yang memang mungkin mendorong saya untuk membeli dan tetap main DATV ini, mungkin kalau gambarnya sampah dan combatnya jelek saya refund dari awal hehe, untuk ditaruh overall kayaknya 5/10 banget itu juga ketolong karena masih optimize dibanding DD2.",1731221801,1731221801,True,6,5,0.5709584355354309,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

[list]
	[*][b]Character Creation (CC)[/b] is good so far, and even the hair is fabulous with physics, unlike the previous game. If you still think it looks bad, that’s more of a skill issue to set.
	[*][b]The Intro[/b] is different from the previous game and feels rushed—there’s just too much happening at the beginning.
	[*]It’s [b]not a truly open world[/b], but if you’ve played [i]DAO[/i] and [i]DA2[/i], you’ll recognize the typical map of it. It’s more like linear dungeons than open world.
	[*][b]Dialogue wheel[/b] is the same as in the previous games, with options to be diplomatic, sarcastic, or aggressive like in [i]DA2[/i]. There’s also a bit of [i]DAI[/i] style with sad, accepting, angry, etc., reactions when giving a response. I don’t understand the hate saying you can't be mean to someone. I mean, you can be sarcastic, right? This game doesn’t have a silent protagonist like the Hero of Ferelden, so it’s harder to convey the same meaning through dialogue text and the spoken words. Even [i]DA2[/i] and [i]DAI[/i] have to suffer for this as well, you pick a sentence, but after hearing the MC say the words, it’s not what you meant.
	[*][b]Combat [/b]feels like a mix of [i]DA2[/i], [i]ME3[/i], and [i]MEA[/i] for controlling which skills to use. I’m not a fan of this. It feels like Dragon Age doesn’t have its soul anymore, especially since you can’t control companions like in the previous games. But I do like the gameplay as Rook mage, as you can infinite dodge step-fade, iframes with skill and use shielding with some cool effects. Also, I think when using a dagger, it feels like you parry enemies when performing a perfect dodge—though I’m not sure, maybe it’s just a coincidence. I played in underdog just in case.
	[*][b]Exploration : [/b]You have to explore and not just blindly follow the main quest marker. Some side missions are secret unless you're in area, and if you’re not careful, you’ll miss them.
	[*]Prioritize [b]side quests[/b], especially for factions and companions, before advancing to main quest. Trust me.
	[*][b]Companion banter[/b] is still tolerable (not as bad as [i]DAO[/i] with Alistair whining or Morrigan disapproval of everything). Once you get to know your companions and do their personal missions, it gets better. For example, at first, I thought Bellara was like Sera—trying to be goofy but failing miserably and just annoy us. But after doing her first mission, I understood her more. Pairing her with Harding makes for some great lore banter, as they talk about elven language and dwarven similarities and lost overtime, which is a nice touch.
	[*][b]Teambuilding[/b] in RPG feels almost nonexistent in this game. The enemies mostly target the Rook, and if you’re playing as a mage, it’s worse. In previous games, we had early warrior tanks like Cassandra, Aveline, and Alistair. In [i]DAV[/i], Davrin comes too late, and even when you build him for a taunt build with Battle Cry, it only works for maybe 4 seconds before enemies start chasing your Rook again.
	[*]If you feel the game is too [b]colorful[/b], you can turn off the bloom effect in the profile settings.
	[*]The game still has [b]dark vibes[/b] at certain points, basically after the tutorial. If you missed it or didn’t notice, it’s probably because everyone’s too busy riding the bandwagon about the culture war.
[/list]


[b]Overall[/b], this is a good fast-paced action fantasy RPG if you’re new to the series. But by [i]Dragon Age[/i] standards, it’s mediocre. It lacks a detailed codex with relevant lore, and the entries are too short to be meaningful. Also there’s a Kossith (people of Thedas call them Qunari) as part of Shadow Dragon in the middle of Minrathous(Or Dock Town no idea still its near tho), a capital city in Tevinter..... come on, Bioware, even if they’re Tal-Vasoth, it’s a weak excuse for lore just to make it work for filling quotas. The worst part is the NPC reaction to the Elven Gods. No one seems to care, which is bizarre given that the Elven Gods are [i]real[/i]—like, F-word actually real. Schoolar across Thedas should be in shambles right now, same as Andrastian chantry in the south. Even [i]DAI[/i] handled weaks8 villains like Corypheus better with how Orlais and Ferelden act dired at that time. Lastly, the sacred of eluvian in crossroad to across Thedas its like common now that every city, ally, and acquaintance of the Veilguard seems to have one before meeting Rook and unlocking it from the Crossroads.


[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
I still haven’t finished the game, so I’m not ready to give it a final score. But if I had to rate it right now, I would give it a [b]7/10[/b]. So, give it a try if you still doubt it— ignore those ragebaiter youtuber who's always angry. Bioware has clearly shifted their focus to appeal to newer fans and put us [b][i]old fans as relic of the past[/i][/b], so if you enjoy fast-paced combat like [i]GoW[/i], you’ll probably like this. Whether you want to get the game at full price or on sale is up to you, but for old fans, it's probably best to get it on sale when it's at least 50% off.",1730858693,1731231958,True,112,25,0.5707712769508361,23,False,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

Couldn't stop playing but will come and write a hell of a review when and IF I can stop playing.

EDIT AFTER FINISHING(70 hours):

Buy it on sale(just got %35 not even 2 months after launch, isn't that amazing?), turn your DA brain off, have fun and forget it.

After finishing the game - watching every ending possible, I honestly fell into a love/hate relationship with this entry.

Pros:
- Visuals, graphics: The game has amazing visuals environment-wise. Some places are just breathtaking, I simply stopped and watched the scenery sometimes. 

- Gameplay: Look I’m a DAO fan when it comes to my favourite in the series; but playing recent titles like BG3 and replaying the trilogy before DAV came out made me realize they are janky as hell for today’s standards -doesn’t mean I wanted to see a similar gameplay- but, damn the DAV gameplay is frigging fun. I had the most fun I’ve had this year -besides LAD8- while I was playing. The mage mechanics are like a dream come true for me, especially the “spellblade” specialization. I don’T think I can even play another class. But from what I’ve seen rogue and warrior is also hella fun to play as well. 

- Hair mechanics/CC; Don’t @ me. I’ve played every entry in the series with and all DA fans know that the vanilla options were always godawful. Everybody lost their mind when a certain series 6th game has showed similar mechanics in their trailer and you’re telling me I’M exaggerating when I have those mechanics in front of me now? Shut it. CC is also one of the good ones we've got in these types of games. Is it perfect? No. Is it detailed enough to make me spend more than an hour trying to look at every single thing? Yeah.

- Linear open world: I don’t know if this is a thing, or I could call that. I’m someone who rarely complains about a game’s map being too much as long as it doesn’t feel extremely empty (I’m looking at you AC: Odyssey, love you but, seriously?) E.g.: DAI never feels to big or boring to me. The maps are big enough to give you the satisfaction of exploring them but not tire you out. It was definitely one of the nice parts about the game.

- Solavellan Content: Not exactly happy, but at least we got something, I am content with having a closure and can live with that.

Cons:
- Character designs: Don’t get me wrong, the characters look beautiful but I’m on the team that thinks body proportions are weird. That’s all.

- Godawful writing: The story is like a summary of what could’ve been. It feels like the assignment you remember you’re supposed to turn in but started working on it before the due date. In some parts it feels rushed, doesn’t even make sense, totally disregards or doesn’t mention the lore that has been established. Factions are just...there, not having very much depth to them, but existing so that you can grind something to get the best ending. Like, remove the LoF and nothing changes. I don't understand why Veil Jumpers are named like that while literally being artifact hunters. Races doesn't mean much because Rook is always conradicting themselves about their origin, doesn't matter how you want it to be -because you cannot tell what they'll say with some options- I understand wanting to attract new players to the series but doing it so by literally SANITIZING and DUMBING DOWN the lore of the previous three entries is a huge betrayal to your loyal fanbase. Quite a number of people told me that ""Well, the conflicts weren't THAT well established in the previous entries either."" which I agree, but they were building up to DA4, it was getting better and better imo and we have...nearly nothing in this game? Suddenly they're gone? The whole Tevinter and the nasty stuff is just mentioned in passing and literally the plight of the Elven, the most bullied race since the fall of Arlathan is just...gone? What the actual hell. And don’t even get me started about the Dev AMA on Reddit, ‘twas the day that I nearly started hating the game.

We all know that “Show, don’t tell” is -arguably- the best approach. This game? This game TELLS. It doesn’t show. At times -and not rare- it treats players like a dumb kid who needs explanation about even the simplest stuff. Worse part? It repeatedly does so. I don’t know what were those people were drinking to compare DAV to ME2 (I mean, it is similar in some sense) but while ME2 was peak in the series, DAV can never ever come close to that quality. I’m not gonna name names but I think some people are the WORST things that could’ve happened to this series with how they handled this game.



- Companion interactions: Again, before yelling at me, read the following. In the other entries, you’d go to your companions when you wanted to, would ask them bunch of stuff about themselves, about the world, about what’s going on in the game. Here? You go talk to them when they want to talk to you and you mostly talk about their needs and wants. To me that’s less organic than the previous entries. It’s all buddy-buddy and “team” with these guys. Don’t be nice to them and they’re just annoyed at best(and you don’t get the best ending) that’s all. Sure, they have nice stories and backgrounds; but no arguments, no discussions…no headbutting with any of them because of different opinions or how my MC handled things like we had in the previous entries? It’s just MEH overall. And all those talks about DAV having “oh so much romance”…yeaaaah. No. Just compare the length of DAI romance videos to DAV romance videos, that’s all I’m saying. 

- MC: I know everybody has their very detailed backstories for their Rooks and believe me, I like mine as well, but I’d prefer Hawke or Inquisitor to be completely honest. I understand why bringing back Hawke would/could create a problem and but Inquisitor -even as an advisor- makes much, much more sense to me. With all it’s continuity problems and faults, ME series will be always superior to me just because I use the SAME character overall and can see the consequences of my actions better (Yes, even though some choices are considered canon for the sake of not dealing with different outcomes; to me, it provides better consistency through the series even though some of the canon choices are total opposite of mine)

In short/ TL; DR: This game will never be a DAO or DAI for me. At this point, if not for the gameplay and visuals, it would be my least favourite entry among all. As it stands, it is barely above DA2; and hell, DA2 has better story and companions if you ask me at this point. Get it on discount, play it, enjoy the gameplay, and have fun for 60-70 hours, and try not to think about lore much because that’s where you start to get angry and sad about what could’ve been.",1730421418,1734875863,True,11,2,0.6194339394569396,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

Now to be perfectly clear if you're going into this expecting Dragon Age, you'll probably be disappointed - as the game feels a bit more like a spin off that doesn't have the same vibe as the previous games. Putting that aside, with my fairly short playtime atm - it is not horrible even if this review will be pointing out more bad things than good.

[b] Let's start with the good. [/b]
- Firstly kudos, the game runs very smooth - this might be expected but these days most games on release don't even work so for this to be running smoothly it's a great thing.
- Character creator is quite good, plenty of time can be spent in it with quite a few options to pick from (although some of the layout / ordering of items makes you go back and forth a lot)
- Combat while a bit basic, is smooth. Quite easy to pickup and provides few different options for builds (all fairly basic though).
- Decent variety between enemies especially special / boss types
- Intriguing enough where I didn't feel like refunding at 2hrs mark

[b] Now for the bad... [/b]
- Camera behavior is wonky to say the least
- Facial animation are bad
- Minimap is actually pointless - it doesn't even highlight enemies in the vicinity
- Story / writing is really flat and nothing worth remembering
- Climbing & walking the plank are tedious and infuriating
- Does not feel like much of an RPG - firstly your character feels quite disjointed from the world, i.e. my Warden has 0 reaction to darkspawn. Supporting characters have more reaction and lines to events happening around you. Secondly skills & level ups feel just like boxes you're ticking not seeing all that much of a difference in gameplay. Yes you get new skills, but that doesn't really change how you play the game all that much
- Weapon switching / Weapon selection - not only is the switch weapons on the fly a weird behavior but the weapon selection you end up is quite limited i.e. no greatsword (as well as many other popular weapon types)

Normally I'd leave a review after completing the game (or refunding it), but as much as I didn't feel like refunding after 2hrs I am also not pulled back into it - so I have no idea when I'll be done with it. If there are any other experiences worth mentioning I'll make sure to update this review.

But as a game this is an alright title that will provide quite a few hours of casual entertainment. However I do not see it as even close for a GOTY contender or even a DA game.

Combat is a big step up. Lots of yapping, so your mileage may vary based on your enjoyment of yapping (I enjoy a good yap). Writing is OK—people say exactly how they feel pretty frequently rather than struggling to process things like normal people, but I think a decade must've somehow given everyone an extreme case of amnesia because there isn't a single bioware game where people act like people.

If the ending hadn't been so strong, my rating probably would be a 7/10. 

The following review will be generally spoiler-free, though I will reference some things that were part of the marketing material (as vaguely as I possibly can).

[b][u]Performance[/u][/b]
I played on a desktop I built in 2020, with a Ryzen 5 3600X, RTX 2070 Super, and 16 GB of RAM, on a 1440p monitor, with the game installed on a SATA SSD. With most settings at high or medium, and with raytracing off, the game still looked gorgeous. With framerates uncapped, they sometimes exceeded 100 fps, especially in the lighthouse, but I found the experience smoother if I capped framerates to 60 fps. Notably, I was able to keep the detailed hair physics turned on.

The only bugs I experienced in my first playthrough were: 2 crashes, 1 bug related to changing a keybinding, and 2 codex entries that showed up before they should have.


[b][u]Things I Loved[/u][/b]
For context, I played the entire series for the first time in 2015, and have replayed all three games multiple times since then. I loved them all, but DAO is not my favorite, so I had no expectation (or desire) for Veilguard to be Origins 2.0. I also have less patience now for DAI's open-world slog than I did even just a few years ago, though I still love it in general.

-- I LOVE Rook. She wasn't quite as strong a character for me as Shepard or Hawke, but she feels like a real person in a way that the Inquisitor never did for me. I played a Mourn Watch dwarf warrior, and there were numerous times throughout the game that I was reminded where she came from, that she had a past before she joined up with Varric, and that there are people from her past who care about her. Bryony Corrigan's performance was stellar.

-- There was a surprising amount of reactivity for her Mourn Watch background, for being a dwarf, and for being a dwarf from the Mourn Watch. Not all of those dialog options have the specially coded icons for Mourn Watch or dwarves, so it's like the game is actually paying attention to the background you chose. There was only one notable part in Harding's personal questline that I felt like dwarf Rook got ignored when she should have been included, but it definitely wasn't ""what's a Mythal""-levels of jarring (and definitely not gith Tav in BG3 levels of rage-quitting). Just more of a missed opportunity. Rook felt more dwarfy to me than Cadash did, regardless.

-- When going back to the lighthouse, even if the companions don't have quest or conversation icons on them, they almost always still had something new to say. I like that they move around the lighthouse to interact with each other a lot, too.

-- Even though Rook was usually left out of the banter when out in the field, she got to interject occasionally, and I think it was more often than the Inquisitor got to interject. 

-- The overall story. While the situation doesn't seem as hopeless as the one in DA2, I do think the threat feels more real than what Corypheus presented in DAI. It's plenty dark. There are lighter moments (including a few that I think were too light in tone considering the subject matter), but fewer outright jokes than previous games. Early on, I got to leave someone to a pretty grizzly fate, so while Rook is generally a good-hearted person (they are Varric's hand-picked second in command, after all), there are a few opportunities to go a bit renegade.

-- The quest/level design. Fetch quests are pretty much gone. There are a few ""collectables,"" in a way, but they all give you stat increases or skill points. No more endless pinging only to find out that the secret item you found is yet another useless bottle of wine. There is plenty to explore, with some verticality in each zone, but no more empty open-world zones like DAI gave us. They are more akin to the zones of DAO and DA2, and most (though not all) can be revisited after their associated quests for further exploration. 

-- The facial animations are pretty solid, and are a huge step up from Mass Effect Andromeda and DAI.

-- The good scenes are phenomenal. Any scene involving Solas was fantastic in writing, voice acting, tone, and direction, and I'm not even a Solas fanatic. And that ending is one of Bioware's best for its emotional impact. 

-- Due to the LI I chose for my Inquisitor (no, not Solas), their relationship was acknowledged twice, once in a codex, and once in ambient dialog (and possibly twice more in a vague way during dialog with Rook earlier in the game). While more would have always been nice, both instances were very sweet and in-character for the relationship, and they were both welcome bright spots during the amazing, but emotionally-draining, ending.


[b][u]Things That Were Fine[/u][/b]
The dialog. When it was good, it was amazing. A lot of it was just serviceable. I didn't see the Marvelesque quips that other people are complaining about. It was mostly just...average. Not Bioware's best, but definitely not their worst, either. It helped that most of the voice acting was solid (with the possible exceptions of Neve and Harding, who I found to be inconsistent).


[b][u]Things I Didn't Like[/u][/b]
My main complaint with this game is that companion conflicts resolved themselves too quickly. It isn't that they're always nice to each other, because there [i]are[/i] some conflicts between companions. It's that resolving those conflicts takes no effort and very little time, making the found family vibes that the devs were going for feel unearned. There are some companion pairs that got along well from the beginning, and I think those are actually the strongest ones, because there is no cognitive dissonance caused by thinking that they resolved their differences too easily. 

I don't agree with one reviewer in particular who thinks that the dialog is written as if HR is in the room, or as if Rook is talking to 10 year olds. It isn't nearly that bad. But I do think Bioware overcorrected in trying to not have a repeat of certain companions from DAI, who seemed to never get along with anybody. BW would have been far better off leaving some real conflict and tension in there with specific companion pairs, and giving that conflict time to grow before bringing them to a resolution. I don't think ME2-style face-offs are necessary, but some ability for Rook to tell them to knock it off and figure out their shit before they became liabilities would have been great.

For all that the devs talked up their focus on companions, the romances seem pretty lackluster. It's like they took the ME1/ME2 approach here, where you do some flirting, then eventually lock in the romance, and then have a culminating scene near the end of the game, with very little in between. I think some of the companion/companion romances got more acknowledgement in dialog and banter than Rook/Davrin did. Even the option for a repeatable hug or kiss scene would help a lot. If Bioware won't do it, then hopefully modders will be able to.

The timing of that culminating romance scene is bizarre, too, considering what happened immediately before it (which I will not spoil). Having the option to tell your LI to just sit, cuddle, and keep you company would have fit better, I think.


----

In spite of my criticisms, though, I loved the game. I think it fixed a lot of DAI's and MEA's problems, and while I don't think it's my favorite DA game, I do rank it higher than DAI. As long as you go into this game willing to accept it for what it is, I recommend giving it a shot for yourself.

We need to accept that other than the overarching story, Dragon Age is a game about characters and the stories they tell through conflict and strife. This much I can assure you is carried out well in this game. All of the characters have distinct personalities that make me curious about their motivations. As for the woke part, who cares? No one is forcing you to be trans or date the big strong handsome elf (me, I am forcing you because I am weak). Just ignore it if it makes you that salty. On a side note, Dragon Age has always been ""woke"" to some extent. Zevran and Lelianna were romance options regardless of gender in the *early 2000's.* It may not be the beacon of progress we would expect today, but damn was it something. Veilguard, on its own, is a wonderful experience. The writing in the first portion of the game comes off a bit clunky but when the ball starts rolling, it's wonderful.

So far though, the game almost has as much charm as a Dragon Age game should, but I'd like to continue playing to really know for sure, and change my review later.

UPDATE after actually playing a bit: still a positive review, but out of 10 I give the game 6. And that is because of super lame options they give you for answers every time. They are all leading to the same outcome, it really doesn't matter what option out of 3 you will choose. Let's say, as an example (imaginary), someone asks you:
""We have to help them! What do you think""
and your answers are 1)""Yes, of course, they are our friends"", 2) ""I have better plans, but I guess we have no choice"", 3) ""Haha, I can't help even myself, but I'll do what I can"". 

Yeah, different tone and all, but ALL THE SAME. In Baldur's Gate 3 these answers would be 
1) ""Sure, let's kick some as*!"" 2) ""I would rather eat a hedgehog than help these guys"" 3) ""Let's join evil guys and share the loot"".

So the writing is bad. Twists are bad, everything is just an already written book. 

The battles are awesome, the graphics are great and the scenery is a-ma-zing!

I have been playing RPGs since they existed, Ultima, Bard's Tale and the Gold box series are still some of my favourites, so I know RPGs. And that's the thing, this isn't an RPG, it's a fantasy action game that plays and feels like Mass Effect 3 with swords and fireballs. If you are expecting the top down RTWP loveliness of Origins then you may as well go and play Pathfinder or Pillars of Eternity coz you aint getting that here. 
However, what you do have is a silky smooth game with gorgeous art design (never taken so many screenshots), zero bugs and rock solid performance that - playing as a damage dealing thief, at least - was a blast to play from start to finish.

I think the thing that really annoys people is the lack of 'grittiness' - Dragon Age was always a bit low fantasy with some blood, guts and moral quandaries and this does not fit AT ALL with  the 'niceness' of the party characters - the world outside their base is going to sh1t but they are sat around baking cakes or having bookclubs, etc and it does feel like a total disconnect to what the story is trying to tell.

Look at Emmrich for instance - on paper this guy is a bad @ss. An orphan who was raised to be a necromancer in a literal grandiose gothic city of the dead, surrounded by undead, ghosts and other such creatures from an early age. And despite living with all this death his whole life, he is paradoxically so terrified of his own mortality that he seeks to be an ever-living Vecna-style lich. How cool is that background? This guy must be some sinister, introverted obsessive who fights like each fight is his last, due to the potential immediacy of death, right? 
Nah, he is just a lovely old softly spoken grandpa with a Vincent Price quiff who just wants a cup of tea from his comedy sidekick skeleton and to perhaps play some cribbage.
Did I like him though? Yeah he's just 'really nice' like everyone else and they are all equally nice to each other. Bit of a step down from having Minthara in the party but there you go.
The only character with some spirit is Taash bizarrely, the one the anti-woke brigade were so hung up about. They are the only one that reminded me of the older games (the scene where they call Emmrich a 'skull f4cker' was great and made me chuckle).

So, if you can't get over these characters not really feeling like they are participating in the end of the world, (or indeed any of the actual 'gaming' parts of this game - none of them seem to be the type to be mass murdering wizards all day in an explosively cool fashion, except maybe Taash again) then you are not gonna like this - it is a huge disconnect, like I said earlier.
This same exact issue occurs with Marvel's Midnight Suns - brilliant tactical battles, but then a large part of the game is back at home base doing crochet with Captain Marvel or having a picnic with Deadpool. 
They both ascribe to the 'cozy game' approach outside of the main story and I guess a lot of people are finding that hard to swallow and I can see why. 
Me? I just kinda loved it in both games for its straight up weirdness. I glazed over when people spoke and then just enjoyed the actual fighting, levelling up, map exploration, trying to cozy up with Harding but somehow ending up with Taash and the main story finale was brilliant (which shamelessly rips off Mass Effect 2 - but hey steal from the best.)

To conclude: I really, really enjoyed playing this game.

I enjoyed playing it and will start another playthrough soon, but it's not without its (many?) flaws.

Let me start by saying the game runs great. I've encountered a whopping number of 0 bugs in the 90 hours I played. I feel like that's pretty rare nowadays, so congrats to Bioware for this smooth release.

The game looks beautiful. I was not a fan of the artstyle in the trailers, but the environments look great. All regions have their own distinct look and the maps are a joy to walk through. I don't like open worlds, which is why I played Inquisition only 2 times with an 8 year break inbetween. Maps are smaller than Inquisition, but bigger than Origins. It's also not filled with endless fetch quests. Much more of a nice stroll instead of painful struggle through the park.

From the marketing, it was clear that a lot of focus would be on the companions. Personally, I liked all of them. Everyone has their own story and struggles and I appreciated the amount of time we get to spend with them on different kinds of quests, outings and conversations. There's also plenty of banter between them, so make sure to return to the Lighthouse frequently to listen to the their conversations. (edit: and when they're talking while out in the world and they get interrupted by a fight, they'll start over again when the fighting's done! Very nice touch)

The story is mostly fine. It has some high points, it has some low points. The focus on the companions combined with the Suicide Mission-esque final quest(s) makes this game like Mass Effect 2 on steroids. I thought it was great to see everything come together in the end.

Combat is a blast. It's a bit too flashy and shiny sometimes, since it made it hard to see the parry indicator, so I was getting pummeled around a lot. But, as a rogue, it's fluid and fun to play. You're not stuck to preset difficulties, you can customize the settings so you can make it just the way you like it.

All in all, DA:TV did a lot of things the way I prefer them to be, so I got lucky in that regard. It's also why I'm much more inclined to play again as opposed to Inquisition.

However...

The writing, the worldbuilding, the lore... everything feels extremely clean. Sanitized. Sterile. It's not that DA:TV ""isn't dark enough"", since there's plenty of doom and gloom in various quests. It just feels like the doom and gloom is contained within these quests and nothing seeps into the world outside. There is no specific Dragon Age vibe.

Where is the injustice? Discrimination? Oppression? Thedas was filled with that in the previous games. You didn't have to play the city elf origin to figure out how terrible life is for city elves in the alienage. You didn't have to play a mage to get a sense of what it's like to live in the Circle. Kirkwall was a shithole, and you knew that because Hawke would find all kinds of trouble in and around the city. None of that in this game.

The Tevinter Imperium has been mentioned multiple times in the previous games. It's supposed to be this place where it's all powerful (blood) mages and slaves. So in DA:TV, we are in Tevinter... and it feels just like Ferelden. The only region we regularly visit is Dock Town, which might as well be Denerim or Lowtown. There is nothing to set it apart. There is nothing to really build the atmosphere. There are no NPCs to talk to. No bartenders to ask about gossip. There are newspaper stands, but you can't ask the sellers anything. There are some beggars on the streets, so you give them coins, and they don't even thank you. You have no clue what it's like to live there. It doesn't give you a reason to care. At least the cats purr when you pet them. (I LOVE CATS AND THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM)

There are also no shades of grey. Everything is black and white. Factions good, enemies bad. Not once did I have to mentally justify one of the choices I made. The decisions don't really give any room for discussion. Why would you choose Harrowmont over Bhelen? Why did you side with the mages instead of the templars? Do I pimp out my love interest for a chance to survive the final battle or just go for the sacrifice? You just go from A to B or C, but you're never ""wrong"".

The big bads we fight and some of the revelations we uncover should be world breaking, but no one... cares? The Veil Jumpers, who feel like cheap stand-ins for Dalish clans, basically shrug and are immediately willing to join the fight from the start, without any sign of questioning their beliefs or anything. At some point, Rook is being asked if they believe in the Maker, and I suddenly realized that was the first time (IIRC) the Maker was even mentioned. 

It really feels like Dragon Age Light. It took 50 hours until I finally got a ""ma serannas"" and I felt like that Leo DiCaprio meme where he's pointing at the tv in recognition. 

Since the companions love to talk about food: This game is a nice soup, with a few meatballs, but it is sorely lacking noodles and spice. And probably also cheese. It's as if the cooks lost the original recipe and improvised.

If you're new to Dragon Age, then yes, I recommend this game. It's fun to play and not a bad game at all!

-Combat is crunchy and fun. Finally some fluidity after the prior installation in there series (Inquisition) where all you did was holding down R/left click and picked spells/skills each cooldown.
-The art style, the environments are beautiful. The game looks amazing.
-Also, the game runs almost perfectly. I've seen people encounter some serious bugs but I haven't had the tiniest bug during my run.
-There are some serious lore revelations dedicated fans have been theorizing on for years and I've enjoyed finding out the truth of the matter. Also some pretty serious twists too.
-Love the new companions. Tho they can be a bit too squeaky nice at times.

-The qualitiy of writing is inconsistent. One side quest/main story segment can be one of the the most amazing storylines you've encounter in a game and the next can turn out to be the biggest nothingburger whatever.
-Same with the dialogues. More than once I thought to myself ""huh? that it?"" during conversations with companions or npcs.
-It wouldn't be a Dragon Age game without needless lore retcons and I'll be annoyed by them each time. The world of Thedas feels streamlined, the intricacies and complexities watered down, sadly.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed the game. It has its ups and downs but the entire Act 3 is one of the best segments I've played in a game in a while. A huge chapter of Dragon Age has come to an end, and it feels bittersweet for a long-time fan such as myself, but I thoroughly enjoyed the ride.

I only recently played through Origins - Inquisition in anticipation of this game so my feelings on certain reveals might not be as strong as someone who has waited years for this.

THE STORY
🔲 Awful
🔲 Nothing Special
✅ Good
🔲 Great
🔲 FANTASTIC

The Dragon Age series is known for its complex characters & morally ambiguous storylines, something that seems to be missing from this game in most of its quests.
Most of the antagonists/villains are simply factions designed as ""evil"" and that are trying to grab power. It gives the feeling that there is no unique qualities to any of these factions making them all feel like carbon copies of each other with little depth. Not all quests / storylines suffer from this but you start to see the pattern as you go through.
The main story isn't bad but it's not perfect either, some details from the early game are lost on me after how much time I spent gathering collectibles & doing side quests. I loved the whole final act of the game though, it felt very reminiscent of the final mission of Mass Effect 2 with important choices to make.
My biggest gripe with the main story was that Solas & The Inquisitor were sidelined in exchange for lesser characters for 90% of the story.

At the start of the game you pick a faction for your Rook which can add extra dialogue / context to certain scenes throughout main & side content.

I can't touch on the story without mentioning the dialogue. It's really rough at times  and some of the voice direction on certain characters felt off (especially compared to the same character in Inquisition) I do feel though that a lot of the times the dialogue was too modern and wasn't very immersive but it didn't bother me too much in the big picture.

I'm also not a fan of the removal of evil/antagonistic dialogue options that have been in Dragon Age/Mass Effect since the start. Rook feels like a more established character than even Hawke from DA2 did.

Overall I enjoyed what we got but the question lingers in my mind, could we have gotten better?

GAMEPLAY
🔲 Lifeless/static
🔲 Poor
🔲 Average
✅ Good
🔲 Excellent

The gameplay has been by far the WORST part of every Dragon Age for me. Veilguard has changed things significantly and its for the better in my opinion. I actually felt engaged with the combat on Nightmare but it didn't feel overly hard even on max difficulty. The parry timing felt strange for a while, I got used to it eventually and then it felt like second nature.

The Map design is leagues ahead of Inquisition's bloated open worlds. I spent countless hours scouring every map for chests to find the perfect items for my warrior's flaming weapons build, which really paid off in the third act. The skill tree has the right amount of variation between specialisations that make them all feel unique.

Instead of being able to control companions like previous games, you can now only command them to use abilities. I barely ever controlled the companions in past games so this doesn't matter to me but the new streamlined system helped keep the combat flowing for me.

The character creator is amazing and gives you way more options than any BioWare game previously has (it might also be their first good creator)

DIFFICULTY
🔲 Playing asleep
🔲 Some brain usage
✅ Easy to learn / Hard to master
🔲 Difficult
🔲 Dark Souls

GRIND
🔲 Nothing to grind
✅ Isn't necessary to progress
🔲 Average grind level
🔲 A lot of grind
🔲 Too much grind

The grind will depend on what difficulty you're playing. The side quests were generally enjoyable and didn't feel like filler to me. You will need to complete these if you want the best ending though. Gathering chest items for your build will be grindy at least until guides are out showing the location of every item.

GAME TIME / REPLAYABILITY
🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee
🔲 Short
✅ Average
✅ Long (Completionist)
🔲 To infinity and beyond

The game has a lot of replayability on the gameplay side being able to pick between three very distinct classes which all have tons of build potential.

I could see the dialogue getting repetitive on future playthroughs.

There is also multiple endings to replay for.

GRAPHICS
🔲 Low
🔲 Average
🔲 Good
✅ Beautiful
🔲 Reality 2.0

I was sceptical about the art style before release but upon playing I love it. There are a few characters that look a bit off to me but I got used to it as time went on. Runs really well on max raytracing & ultra settings and looks gorgeous.

AUDIO
🔲 Earrape
🔲 Bad
✅ Not too bad
🔲 Good
🔲 Eargasm

The music is one of my major problems with this game. I like the music, but it doesn't feel like Dragon Age. A lot of it sounds more like something you'd hear in Mass Effect. They should've asked Trevor Morris to come back as the music from  Inquisition was perfect. The best part of this games soundtrack is when Lost Elf (from Inquisition) plays.

AUDIENCE
🔲 Kids
✅ Teens
✅ Adults
🔲 Everyone

The game has a less mature feel to it than previous Dragon Age games but I wouldn't call it a ""kid's game"" or ""disney product"" like a lot of people have been saying.

PC REQUIREMENTS
🔲 Potato
🔲 Decent
✅ Fast 
🔲 Rich boi
🔲 NASA

PRICE
🔲 It's free!
🔲 Not recommended
✅ Wait for sale
✅ Worth the price
🔲 Best investment ever done

If you're only going to play the game once and not 100% it, wait for a sale.

If you're a completionist or will play multiple times it's worth full price.

BUGS / CRASHES
🔲 None that I can recount
✅ Minor bugs
🔲 Infrequent crashes
🔲 Frequent crashes
🔲 Complete mess

Before the recent GeForce Driver update, I had no crashes or bugs at all. Since then I've had three crashes over 30-35 hours. The game auto saves frequently enough that it was barely an inconvenience.

The game is good, the story concludes what we've been hearing since origins. If you feel left out, I recommend going back to origins and playing close attention to Flemmeth's story and the codexes.

Disclosure: I've loved each Dragon Age despite and because of their differences between each other. This series has brought me so much happiness and I could not wait for Veilguard's release.

This game has a different pace than all other DAs, the game keeps you moving! The combat is so much more dynamic and it's really fun. You can choose to play just with your own abilities or to open the ability wheel to direct your companions and do combos with them.
Game difficulty is very customizable, HUD is customizable, the settings page is very detailed, worth the time to tailor the game to your preferences.

The maps are way more straightforward than before. If you're the type to rush to complete quests, you won't have much problem finding the place where the fight happens. However, exploration is still there for those that like to take their time to look in every nook and cranny, with useful rewards!
Quests are very action oriented, no collect 10 of anything. Collection can still happen, but only if you want to. Maps will tell you how much there's still to explore and collect.

Different than our Inquisitor in DAI, Rook knows how to use their hands when climbing, which makes exploration way less frustrating.

If you know the story, you're in for a treat. There's so much lore right away! It's very rewarding to get answers and to see familiar faces.
For those that will pick up this game as their first Dragon Age and want to know who is who and what is what, the codex is there to help but the companions will explain and expose the story for you, you won't feel left out.

The UI is so satisfying! Everything is so organized and neatly categorized. It identifies clearly when there's new stuff to look at and if you don't care for codexes and want to see the little indicator go away, there's a ""mark all as read"" option :)

I'm very happy with this game, can't wait to play more.

I'll update this later when I'm deeper, but for now... 3.5/5? TL;DR it's fun, but not memorable.

It's... a frustrating game. It feels like AAA game producers focus to get some elements perfect, while others they're happy to just check the box. Graphics? Lots of effort - the game is beautiful, I actually really like the slightly more stylized faces, the regions and backdrops are all beautifully imaginative and well realized. Dialogue and script? It's more checking a box. Great voice actors? Check, but it seems like no one proofread their scripts, and each line is weirdly taken out of context or re-edited so the emphasis is wrong. Everyone repeats proper nouns again and again and again in the same conversation. Realistic and immersive dialogue is so important to a modern game, but it seems like producers aren't interested in spending money to bring a voice cast together to actually run lines with each other or mocap. It's a shame, those little details and polished elements are what make a game great.

Then the script itself - again, it seems to have had interesting edges sanded down. It's... fine. Everyone is a little ""I'm writing cool dialogue"", Marvel-esque quips and asides. Some of that is fun, but EVERYONE is in on it. There's no straight man to play against, so rather than fun gallows humor it just feels like it lowers the stakes.

Overall, it's Mass Effect 2 only with swords and not quite as good. I'm enjoying it, but it's not an instant classic, and it's probably only getting one playthrough.

There were great moments, but the ""magic"" of Bioware is gone and I am left feeling hollow and sad about the decisions that were made regarding it's development (and also regarding the loss of the writers/devs that made Dragon Age what it was). 

Solas, and every interaction with him (up until the very end, as a Solasmancer from Inquisition) was fantastic and I wanted more of it. 
By comparison, the romance/bonding aspect of all Rook's companions felt very lackluster, when it was like 20+ hours before the romance started happening. Not to mention a lot of the interactions felt ""same-sy""; there were hardly any conflicts and those that happened were quickly resolved; between Rook and their companions, between the companions themselves, and between the cast and the world around them.

The combat system was fun, though the 3-person team felt very strange, especially when I realized I never needed to have a warrior-mage-rogue team anymore, and unlocking chests, traps, and doors is no longer a thing.
 
The style and design of the game (especially the environments) is drop-dead gorgeous, but the music is a hit-or-miss and sometimes feels very out of place; sci-fi/vaporware while travelling around in Arlathan forest.

Every Dragon Age game mixes up the gameplay formula and admittedly Veilguard is the game that deviates the most from the rest of the game. If you're looking for origins style tactics, you're not going to find it here. As someone who never really engaged much with the more tactical aspects of Dragon Age, I don't mind that. I never switched to controlling other party members and just focused on blasting the bad guys, it's not a feature I miss. 

To describe the combat I'd say it is as a mix of Jade Empire and Mass Effect. Lot of focus on dodging and attacking and timing, very modern style console gameplay. I'd even throw in a comparison to 2018's God of War because it does feel similar to that at times but it's not quite that either. You control your companions in combat like you do in Mass Effect, meaning you don't actually control them but can activate their abilities and the introduction of the combo system is pretty fun when you manage to pull it off.

The level design is also very reminiscent of Mass Effect. You have well designed mission levels with some combat arenas thrown in and then you return to your central hub to talk to your companions and touch base after story beats.

As for the writing, it feels like Dragon Age. Specifically it reminds me most of Dragon Age 2 but that's my favorite Dragon Age game so I don't mind that. Very quippy, a lot of banter, and I can play a purple Rook so it's all good in my book. Still meeting all the companions so far but all the ones I have met are great and I'm excited to meet the rest!

I will admit I am a little disappointed that past game choices don't matter as much but after getting my hands on the game, I understand why that is. I will say that the game has a lot of call backs to books and comics that have been released over the ten years since Inquisition came out so sometimes characters will pop up like they're kinda expecting you to know who they are and that's why you can get a cameo feel on some side characters when first meeting them. It feels a little strange if you didn't engage with all the supplementary dragon age media but its a fun nod for all the people who do know them. 

For people comparing it to Baldur's Gate 3, you have to remember that despite being rpg games, they're doing different things. Dragon Age is about being a hero and saving the world so while you can be a d*ck, you can't be evil. The game just isn't meant for an evil player the same way you can't play Mass Effect and expect to be able to side with Cerberus or the Reapers. If you're looking for something like Baldur's Gate 3 that lets you be a d*ck AND evil if you want to be, I'd suggest going to check out Owlcat's Rogue Trader. It's space fantasy but in gameplay and story, I'd say it's closer to Baldur's Gate 3 than Veilguard or any Dragon Age game is. Baldur's Gate 3 and Dragon Age/Veilguard are different games and as someone who loves both, I think they deserve to be evaluated on their own merits as they are different games trying to do different things.

Overall, I would recommend this game if you're a big fan of Dragon Age and are willing to engage with the game for what it is, an action focused rpg where you get to play an underdog hero against impossible odds doing their best to save the world. If you still have some reservations, maybe wait until it's on sale in a few months to try it or take a look at some of the other crpgs that exist that can offer the sort of tactical gameplay or story telling approach that you're looking for.",1730487321,1730487547,True,59,20,0.5535833239555358,8,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

But does it do justice to the series as a long awaited sequel? Not really. Though reading Tevinter Nights beforehand lead to some nice surprises.

The graphics look very good, even though the overall style needs some getting used to. 
The combat is fun, but the companions sadly feel rather redundant. 
I find the story and new lore enjoyable, yet the dialogues are for the most part underwhelming. The setting and characters are interesting, the voice actors do a fine job but the writing doesn't manage to tie everything together which leads to a weird mix of dark fantasy themes on one side and lighthearted, comically adventure on the other with neither being very well executed. It's rather irritating how in a lot of serious or dire situations the characters just keep smiling happily and throw around one liners, making everything feel less authentic.

The overall structure and flow of quests and mechanics have improved from the previous game and are more similar to Mass Effect. I just wish they had kept some things like ""do companions quests"" or ""you have to make choices btw"" to some tutorial boxes instead of having characters overexplain these things, leading to rather awkward conversations.

Everything considered Veilguard is not brilliant but it's not terrible either. If like me you get most of an RPGs enjoyment out of the characters and dialogues this game might be a bit more on the disappointing end though.  It's still worth a try, both for new players and fans.

The good - 
 - The game is very well optimized for an EA game. No EA launcher, game runs very smoothly, and I have yet to encounter any bugs of any kind.

 - Character creator is robust enough you can make pretty much any character you want.
 - The story so far is good enough to want to keep going.

The bad - 
 - It feels like they were trying to achieve the quippy comedy style of the MCU Avengers and it falls flat 90% of the time. 
 - There doesn't feel like there is a lot of real choice in dialogue. Everything says something slightly different, but ultimately ends up the exact same regardless of what you do. It feels kind of empty.
 - The game feels way to streamlined compared to previous installments.

As someone who has played all of the Dragon Age games (including their DLCs), watched the movie, TV show, machinimas, etc. Read the books, the comics, the anthologies and novels, and the Dragon Age Day short stories, and overall is just a big Dragon Age and Bioware nerd, I can wholly say I do believe DATV is a wonderful, beautiful game that strives to honour its universe and almost entirely pulls it off. Review below is off of one playthrough (around 70 hours).

[h3] The Good: [/h3]
- It's well written. The beginning can feel a bit weak but ultimately I was rather enraptured by it and my love for the universe pushed through anything. By the end of the first act, you will be entirely sucked in. This game is like a literary rolling ball of snow on a mountainside, it'll keep picking up snow and getting better and better. The point of no return and onwards is amazing.
- These are finally games that are not grueling mechanically. DAO, DAII and DAI have all, for lack of a better word, aged very badly in my opinion on the combat front and certainly show their age. It happens. This game's combat, movement, mechanics, etc. alongside a reworked talent tree system for player and companions are a breath of fresh air and help to keep something like the Great Hinterlands Slog from repeating itself as you chop your way to through the waves of side quests.
- Codex is incredibly expansive. Missive system is a wonderful way to show us extended show of what we done, and keep us posted on all the horrible things happening to the south. The new glossary system is great for new players.
- Speaking of new players, this is definitely designed in mind that with a 10 year break, to be able to introduce a new audience to Dragon Age. It is very easy to get in especially with the above systems, and (to the chagrin of older players, I'm sure,) the fact it is a whole new part of Thedas we've not really been in before where a majority of our decisions do not follow us (alongside the incredibly complexly evolving themes in Southern Thedas like the Circle of Magi and the ever-stoked conflicts of Mages and Templars), help to make it not as daunting in my opinion.
- The choices have good butterfly effects, and I found myself sitting there for a while (especially nearing the end) when you're quite literally balancing characters living and dying in your hands.
- Visually stunning. Probably the most beautiful game I've played in years. There is a reason games like WoW and Guild Wars outlast hyper-realism competitors, and the stylistic choices of Dragon Age (that have always been there, just now in High Resolution) are going to help this game keep its charm for a long time.
- Quite dark. It's Dragon Age after all! I've seen a lot of complaints that it's too lighthearted, that they've strangled the darkness from a grim IP, but I'm here to say that is definitely not the case. That darkness situates itself very early in D'Meta's Crossing, and especially in the end of Act 1. It only gets progressively darker, Dragon Age has not lost its edge, some of the darker political aspects are merely not present because we are in a very different political climate (that has its own issues, mind you).
- Solas is written as well as ever, Varric too. Inquisitor's OG voice actors return and do a fantastic job, alongside some other surprises!
- Companion stories were awesome, side quests were a lot better. Hurrah, the Hinterlands slog is dead! I think I only felt the weight of it once or twice (mostly because I was up way later than I should be), completing them was very incentivizing. My personal favourites were Bellara, Davrin and Harding. The others were great too, those were just standouts to me (sans Taash, who while I did enjoy and actually think had one of the best voice acted finale quests, I had a lot of issues with you can read about below).
- Map exploration is good, I 100%'d all zones (except Arlathan Forest... could not find that 11th chest for the life of me). I ended the codex around upper 80s percentage completion. There is a lot hidden, collectionists will enjoy it.

[h3] The Not-so-Good: [/h3]
- Yes, we lost a lot of choices, but in theory, the next game (fingers crossed) could pull from the previous three DA games and this new one if we return to the south. They do a pretty decent job at not making it feel bad, because we are so far away from Southern Thedas that a lot of those decisions wouldn't rubber band upwards. But I mean-- come on, no Well of Sorrows choice? That's a bit of a smack in the face. The added downside of this is because they don't want to invalidate those choices, they just avoid them. The most you'll get is small cameos.
- Above ties into an issue I have with this game: this game comes a few years too late. A few years ago, we were in the great nerd renaissance. D&D was becoming popular, people were getting hype about Baldur's Gate 3, etc. RPGs were becoming popular, but ultimately modified and watered down to suit a more mainstream audience. A lot of the role-playing in RPGs during this time lost its depth and detail. Dragon Age: The Veilguard delivers a wonderful game, but one that has somewhat watered itself down with its loss of carry over details and some narrative choices to suit a newer, broader playerbase. It ultimately comes in a time of people now deciding they are, actually, okay with heavy and lengthy RPGs like the original 3.
- Some of the scenes felt out of place, or sometimes awkwardly transposed. Dragon Age has always been 80s action movie adjacent so I didn't mind the modern speak too much, because it knew when to reel itself in. However, I did find some of Taash's insistent joking (and rebound to joking after a certain important narrative in their story happens) to be a let down. Taash's story is a very mixed bag for me, one I feel is... not amazing. Their voice actor absolutely kills it in their final companion quest and turned me around from hating it, but I found the message they were sending with their story to be well-intentioned, but ultimately clunky and almost preachy at times. I felt this especially in [spoiler] a choice you can make to tell them only to accept Rivani culture, or Qunari culture, sending a message to the player that someone who struggles to identify in their native culture and their lived culture is impossible, and you must just simply choose. For a story that puts so much effort into the gender struggle of Taash, it entirely fell flat (and offensive at times) in how they decided to tell Taash's struggle with cultural/ethnic identity. I didn't really want to choose and felt uncomfortable that Rook was the one to basically decide their identity in a player choice, instead of THEM shaping it. And this happens TWICE! Ugh. [/spoiler]

[h3] The Meh: [/h3]
- Music is good, but ultimately Hans Zimmer is no Trevor Morris (or even Inon Zur). The music is great, but where I would sit and sometimes just let DA play in the background for ambient zone musics, or find myself distracted by the BGM of an important scene previously, I did not find Zimmer managing to capture me in the same way that Morris and Zur did.
- My romance (Lucanis) felt lackluster, and sometimes even ill-timed. I enjoy what we got, but we did not get enough of it. The game could have easily added in at least two to three more companion scenes for romance, and I could say when too. The final companion intimacy scene also felt out of place. [spoiler] Nobody wants to freak it and giggle right after someone dies, seriously! [/spoiler]

[h2] Overall: [/h2]
100% my GOTY, and I see myself playing again and again. The good outweighs the bad here, and I loved it. Anyone claiming the writing is intolerably bad, that the game is all 'woke', or its not dark enough anymore hasn't finished the game, quite literally ever played a DA game before, or is just attention baiting. It's good, especially for 10 years of developmental hell.",1730841526,1730841673,True,9,2,0.5494219660758972,2,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

this is my review about what i think of the game after 85 hours save with a rogue class. not here to have a discussion about what is right or wrong. didn't receive this for free or anything like that. just trying to provide my opinion about my experience.

the game is like a 8/10 for me. nothing exceptional or revolutionary to this genre compared to the past dragon age games.

what i think its positive about this game:
1 - The combat is pretty nice and fluid, weak spot mechanics for rogue works pretty well with bow.
2 - The choices the game provide and the difference between then. the impact of some choices actually matter for some choices during the game (if we have a new game in future and chance to import the save, they will matter even more)
3 - The plot and the quests/side quests are pretty good.
4 - The upgrade progression for the equipment is works well for the way they designed
5 - The skills works fine for 3 buttons (it will have negative about it as well) but for 3 skills setups isn't bad

the negative part about it:
1 - The game miss most RPG elements from the past games like a more group setup like a proper healer, a proper tank and some specifications for DPS.
2 - I really missed 4 members groups, its related about the missing more RPG mentioned on the first topic.
3 - Playing with only 1 automatic skill being used its not that fun, having more automatics skill or if I'm able to choose which ability i want to be automatic like the heal from Bellara or the Taunt from Davrin. would be nice if they can have at least the 3 abilities being used automatic.
4 - The companions have more gears slot and equipment, most of then are focused on detonation combos like this is a must happen mechanics. more skill related to their skills would be nice and better. we have so much gear on main characters and almost nothing to then. using ring and neck could be good.
5 - I missed in Inquisition and miss here too, the lack of the tactics we had on Origin. I know its an action game and not a tactical one like before but would be nice if we could have that option as well.

most of my complains about the game is related to the group and companions because that could be improved a lot to be honest, i really don't feel playing a RPG game like used to be because everyone kind have heal. only difference is the taunt but anything else its just action. the tactical like used to be wont be easy to anyone but the RPG elements of the game is kind important. not everyone should be able to do everything.

but this is a great game in general, please if you don't like the non binary thing you can ignore because its EA but they did a good job with this game this time. its ok for you to learn a bit more about it if you don't know, but if you don't like its ok too... don't let that ruin your experience with the game. so many good dialogues, a nice story telling game, good combat, amazing companions for you to know about it.

wait for a discount if you don't think its worth right now but the game is good. its an amazing RPG. its not a Baldur's gate 3 (nothing will be so soon) but deserve to be played as well

It's a very lively and modern Action Adventure game with light RPG elements that takes some of the best parts from its predecessors but is also brave enough to step out of their shadows.

The Veilguard has a very earnest atmosphere of a proper adventure supported by amazing visuals both in its various locations and the main cast you travel with. Some might say that the game feels too light and lacks conflict, and it's true may be less outwardly dark than some of its predecessors, but there are still plenty of grim and sombre stories to uncover as you play. Besides, it does pick up on some grimness in the second half if you're into that.

As for the characters, I found that cast to be pretty great — every character fills a certain pretty transparent archetype but all of them also have their demons and secrets that take time to discover, and this progression feels pretty natural for the most part. I will concede that dialogue takes a bit of a backseat in this one since the game is generally more streamlined and you get significantly fewer properly sprawling dialogue trees, but it works well with the kind of game that this is, and I don't find it to be a problem at all thought it might not be to everyone's taste.

The combat system is up there with Bioware's best attempts in the Mass Effect series, and it's certainly by far the best one we've seen so far in Dragon Age. It's simple on the surface, and if you play on standard difficulty or below you may not feel the need to engage with it beyond what you're given in the initial tutorials. But if you're having fun like I did, it's pretty cool to try out different skills, equipment, ability combos with your party, etc. It feels great, it looks great, it can be pretty chaotic but ultimately very satisfying.

I also enjoyed the light metroidvania touches in this one, running around unlocking new rooms and chests probably took me as much time as everything else, some of the puzzles are pretty fun, and I was relieved to find out that I didn't have to frantically switch out party members to unlock certain character-specific puzzle elements.

As is tradition for Bioware games, it's pretty great when it comes to accessiblity and inclusivity. You see lots of accessibility options right as you launch the game, and I can't be 100% sure but it seems to be pretty comprehensive. As for inclusivity, the game gives you plenty of options regarding your character's customization allowing to make them more like you if you're good at character editors (I'm hopeless with them), and you can customize your pronouns and gender as you like including changing them in the game as you go. The cast of characters is also pretty diverse, and all the inclusive touches feel very natural — one of the first characters you meet has a prosthetic foot and it doesn't stop her from being battle-capable and just generally cool at all.

Finally, and this might be surprisng for an AAA release in 2024, The Veilguard is also virtually bug-free and runs pretty smoothly right out of the gate, with lots of options to tweak to make sure you get a smooth experience.",1730843932,1730843932,True,4,0,0.5474790334701538,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

Good: 
Combat: Feels fun and fluid, I'm playing a spellblade and the move between ranged staff/orb to melee with orb and dagger feels great. The fights themselves are engaging, though definitely if action combat is something you're used to, they may not pose a high challenge on the normal difficulties (I went for nightmare, and I'm feeling it, but perhaps explorer would feel a little cut-and-dry.)

Overall lore/factions: each faction has a lot of history to find and learn, plenty of side quests, pretty high stakes. It's a very much fleshed out version of the way factions were sort of handled in DAI, and I appreciate that. The faction you choose at the start is fairly meaningful, when talking to those of that faction, you'll often have different voice lines from them and for you to choose. 
The lore itself is honestly very interesting! It fleshes out a lot of concepts we've always known in the DA universe with more information and explains some of the things DAI and 2 brought into question concerning the nature of the gods in Thedas. 
Romances: as always with DA, the romances are at least 1/4 of the active braincell of these games. Each seems impactful and diverse, and the characters are charming and have their own ways of showing care and overall affection. The story quests surrounding companions are also really enjoyable, and I highly recommend taking the time to do each rather than rushing the main story, as they really flesh out the story as well as the individuals. The banter is also brilliant, and vastly improves in timing and quality from DAI.

Cons: 
Overall Dialogue: this isn't really a slight on everything, the dialogue vastly improves in the game and really it's only the opening that feels overly 'dragging this player through the lore so we don't have to explain it later'. There are occasional lines that come off as cheesy or flat but previous installments of DA all had that issue on occasion as well and it honestly doesn't happen very often after the first few quests in act 1. 

Romances/companions(again): this is in both, partially because 1, I wish there were a system like the dial for rook that shows group affinity with eachother, as Romances between characters can happen and it would be nice to be able to know where they're at. 2, I wish there was a little more to the romances once established. It really doesn't need to be much more, but you can't often casually converse and typically need to wait for scripted moments. The scripted moments are great, but there is less of the casual interaction that previous installments have. 
Pacing: it's not a big thing, and it's definitely remedied by side quests which feels like it was probably meant to be, but the pacing is at times rushed. Act 2 has been better, but all of act 1 feels like we're going waaay too fast into each situation. It adds to the importance of everything yes and like I said can be remedied with side quests/puzzles/factions, but if you are not doing so, it also feels like the game wants you out of act 1 as quickly as humanly possible.",1730657722,1730657722,True,6,1,0.547454833984375,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

The story is very good and those saying it is not as dark as previous games I feel like are missing something. Yes, it has its lightheartedness, as did previous games, but there are definitely sections of the game where the narrative and consequences on your team are quite severe. It definitely gets better as the game progresses as well.

Dialogue can be a bit iffy and cringe at times, but this isn't anything different than previous games. I do feel like some of the voice acting is a bit stiff at times and it does suck that while the game has insane graphics, the lipsync is off at times as well.

Combat is a departure from previous games but given the way combat has been evolving over the past three, it makes sense. It feels like combat from Dragon Age 2 but a lot more nuanced. I do miss having a lot more abilities to use, but it is fun to switch around my loadout and see what combos I can do with my companions. Even on a lower difficulty, it still feels challenging and you still need to think about what you're doing in regards to barriers, armour, and shields.

Exploration feels as if its been cut back from Inquisition, which is somewhat welcome. Inquisition had a lot of areas which felt empty and a lot of the sidequests were simple fetch quests. Side quests in Veilguard feel impactful to the narrative, but I do with the areas were a bit more open. Main missions are quite linear but this is fine in contrast with the explorative side elsewhere.

My biggest issue is the companions. Previous games have let you speak to your crew whenever, ask them questions about themselves and their backgrounds. You go up to them every now and again and they have new things you can talk to them about. In Veilguard, you can only directly engage with companions when the game tells you that you can. Your options for dialogue and questioning can be quite limited. You do occasionally get a voiceline here or there when you walk past them but it's nothing to engage with. This has severely impacted how long it's taken me to feel connected to the companions, and for a game that changed its name from Dread Wolf to Veilguard because they were so proud of your team... it feels off. 

It's a good game, the story is enjoyable, but it's not without fault as with any game ever made. Considering some of Bioware's recent games... This is a huge step up. Is it Game of the Year? Probably not, but overall the pros outweigh the cons for me and *I'm* having fun, and that's what matters.",1731261973,1731261973,True,5,0,0.5473715662956237,0,False,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

8/10 as an action RPG
4/10 as a Dragon Age
2/10 as an Inquisition sequel

First, the good stuff:
1. The game runs well and looks great. The locations are varied and very beautiful, the character editor allows you to create a great character without resorting to mods. The game is visually pleasing to be in. The Necropolis, Arlathan are such magical unique places, and Minrathous brings back memories of Kirkwall.

2. The game really follows gameplay trends and has adopted best practices. Everything is designed for the player and creates a smooth gameplay experience that is comfortable to be in. 

3. The combat system is finally no longer so static and players are given the opportunity to dynamically participate in combat, I think it has benefited the game. The combat system is friendly to both beginners and allows for various build options for more experienced players.

Now about the bad:
The entire writing part of the game is VERY weak. And when I say WEAK, it doesn't mean that everything is terrible, everything is... uneven. There are good parts, there are not so good parts, there are frankly bad parts. And as everyone knows, writing is the skeleton on which the game is built, and here it cannot withstand the weight of it.

1. The entire narrative is built on the fact that we are the Hero and the Savior from the very first second of the game - no one asks us questions (even though the story we tell the world is frankly insane, and we ourselves are unknown to the world and have no authority), the world exists around us and the opportunity to give us a quest, and then praise us for completing it. We are not led to decisions, we are presented with facts. Many things are not explained at all, there are just gaps in the storylines.

2. Most of our companions have the character depth of a teaspoon. They are written lazily, shallowly, stereotypically and practically devoid of ideas. Okay, I apologize professor Emmerich, you are a great guy. In the end, instead of the unique characters we had in the previous games, here we just have a bunch of fun color-coded guys.

3. I got my suspicions when at the beginning of the game I was not being asked to connect my Keep - and my suspicions were justified. This game absolutely despises the entire previous series. Yes, we are given minor fanservice, mentioning characters we knew or events we participated in, but it all feels more like fairy tales from another reality. Veilgard is disconnected from the DA, disrespectful to the history of the series, dismissive of the lore. A lot of the threads that have been running through the series since the first game are just lost, others are handled poorly (remember, bad writing). This is the most annoying and frustrating part. I could live with a game with an uneven plot that takes 20 hours to get going and boring companions, but it shouldn't have been called Dragon Age. I rarely agree with ""fans of the series"", but in this case, I absolutely agree with the general consensus. Veilgard leaves the previous games like scorched earth.

And just fun details:
1. The new elf body models are ugly. Elves have always had this unique silhouette that gave them a regal look. Here they look like they're about to try to sell you turnips.

2. If you're going to use recurring characters that played important roles in previous games, treat them with respect. I was expecting Dorian to be some professor type character, but what we got was an uncle with a drinking problem who embarrasses everyone at family gatherings and looks terrible. I hope someone comes up with a mod to fix this, it was the first thing that really pissed me off about this game.

3. The first game in the series where I didn't develop a single romantic relationship. The only character that appeals to me looks about my father's age. Really?

4. Why did the Inquisitor come to the fight in pajamas and look like a nameless NPC in the finale?

To sum it up, I'm leaving this game a positive review because I'm having fun with it and it's mechanically enjoyable to play. But my level of annoyance and disappointment with the writing leaves me in a terrible state of mind thinking about how this game could have shined, but now that opportunity is gone forever and there's nothing I can do to change it.",1730901574,1731606024,True,3,0,0.5470144152641296,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,positive,100

You should not trust them, EA Games has no soul & only exists to maximize profits. If you don't ask for or even authorize intrusive potentially predatory software, that software is malware. Spyware. Rogue. The fact that the EA Background Service installs without permission & runs 24/7 with no provision for turning it off or opting out means this is a drive-by installation, a hack. It should be illegal, if in fact it's not already illegal.

As to the Mass Effect games you get along with the spyware, they seem fine. The same as I remember. Frankly, without the spyware I think Mass Effect holds up pretty well.

[h1]Quick resume[/h1]

I have never seen a launcher like this one.

""The Halo Collection"" for example, lets you install any game of the list separatedly. ME:LE launcher actually forces installation of all the three games and DLC at the same time, weighing up to 110 gigabytes. There is no option to exit one of its three games straight to the OS neither, it is all very impractical. The launcher frequently behaves in an odd way, but its the ""EA app"" the real cause; slow, unresponsive, I had to turn off overlays. Sometimes after clicking ""play"" on Steam nothing even happened.

A remaster is not about rebuilding, but it should be an opportunity to adjust old things. Sadly, there are too many backsteps here to call it even. From ancient bugs and crashes, to animation and AI, gameplay issues either continues or worsened, negligence from the developers is everywhere. Honesty is my witness, there is nothing in this remaster that justifies the price since 2021. Even voiced translations never had that much effort, PT-BR and others were ignored.

The main benefit of this remaster may only be to reunite DLC material and ease old incompatibilities for newer systems, it's easier now to just install and play Mass Effect already. But none of that matters if decades old bugs or incompetent functionalities remains.

[h1]Mass Effect 1[/h1]

I love the game but I admit the gameplay has always been weird. Mako's painful exploration is prime example, but that was due limitations that they had. This only means ME1 needed more fixing than the others, but let's just say they didn't change enough screws, and it shows. And through the trilogy not only some old issues were ignored, some are now just worse.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3231562656&tscn=1714014744

[code]FIXED I GUESS[/code]

1- I guess graphics had some treatment

There's no ray-tracing or anything, but they did fix some bugs related to textures, including Garrus's low-res texture face bug. Added lightining, mesh models, even a real-time reflection and other FX and audible goodies. Problem is, it doesn't look like they adjusted it much. Uncharted worlds still looks like a pile of useless polygons, now with better lighting and grass. The ""Community Patch"" mod is essential to finish Bioware's attempt.

2- General compatibility

Now you don't need to worry about Windows OS since the first game is very old already. Even Asteroid X57 DLC is already with the game, so that made things easier too. Mechanical issues like joystick, now you can use an actual control of your choice to play the game other than the keyboard.

3- Unit interface

I'm not sure I like it but its more consistent with the trilogy. They did little tweaks in certain guns like some rifles (there is no ""thermal clip"" available, only in the sequel) and other good additions I should mention includes new gameplay options in the menu. Photo mode has been inserted, but without a freer mod its nearly useless.

[code]IGNORED OR FIXED BADLY[/code]

It is a great thing to preserve the original games, but technical adjustments and fixing should've been part of that respect too.

1- Enemy AI for some reason has gotten worse.

They stuck and even phase through floors or walls like never before. I have seen that happening several times. Its the same with allies AI, constantly unresponsive, sometimes won't obey or save commands. They messed with something and never adjusted logics leftovers.

2- Mako can now boost, trying to ease uncharted worlds' pain, but ends up with a weirder driving when you use it. 

3- Whenever a bunch of Geth dies, you're still force-flooded with items.

4- [url=https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WqlUePGw4r4?feature=share]Click here to see[/url] Jabber's video, comparing attention to details from OG to LE, you will be surprised how LE screwed it over.

5- Too easy. They dumbed things down too much, rather than provide classic or accessible options.

6- The Pinnacle Station DLC has been removed

Removing the arena ruined items distribution from stores and looting in ME1, never bothered to adjust it, even in late game you may not even see the Colossus armor for example. They claim they lacked whatever coding to fit that DLC into the game. I can install it from alternative sources in the original game, why couldn't Bioware do it officially?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3231552081

[h1]Mass Effect 2 and 3[/h1]

I'm afraid this remaster will need a remaster.

I hate when companies depends on the fans to do their jobs, but the ""Community Patch"" for the trilogy does exactly that. The game isn't mod friendly and ME-Mod-Manager can be inconsistent, but these technical mods makes the experience a lot better. They can't do everything though.

1- They messed with squad commands AI somehow, so allies are dumber than ever before.

2- An old ram bug is gone for ME2, but no adjustments for the loading animations timing were made.

3- The trilogy now has joystick support, but mapping is only for keyboards. ME2 still has the best gameplay of the trilogy.

4- If you try hardcore mode in ME3 you'll see how the clunky controls have aged horribly. Too easy - they made casual mode the standard in ME3, and normal mode have been nerfed to easy. Ridiculous!

5- The remaster never fixed ME3 ridiculous single-key used for running, to cover, to revive, interact and parry (its always conflicting during gameplay)[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/pqryj8/i_love_mass_effect_but_having_interact_sprint/]click here to see it[/url] how the game often won't respond right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT29L7bWGkM

6- ME2 famous ""typewriter bug"" haven't been fixed. Expect the same negligence for other animation issues etc.

7- The screen resolution swap bug in ME2 is now 14 years old, because they never fixed it.

8- Instead of fixing Kelly Chambers wrong face in ME3, they replaced the wrong face in ME2 instead. (a simple free mod can fix that)

9- They removed the Galactic Readiness multiplayer from ME3, so you won't need to pace it anymore. They adjusted the missing rating with a few cheap Galaxy Map findings.

10- The Leviathan DLC still has the same bug from 10 years ago in the same ladder, when looking for Dr. Bryson's daughter. If it happens, swap resolution back and forth.

12- They changed [spoiler]Tali's face depicted in a photo[/spoiler] and still got it wrong.

13- They tweaked the ending cut here and there, but still is an jumble mess.

14- It is VERY recommended to download ""Expanded Galaxy Mod"" for ME3 and other mods such as Audemus' Happy Ending. Make sure you say thank you to ""KkJiro"". If he's not Bioware he should be.

[h1]Remaster final score: 4.5/10 Fans did it better[/h1]

I won't recommend buying, unless a reasonable discount pops up. In any case then follow my recommendations with patches. EA wasted a great opportunity to give us a decent Steam backgrounds etc. Also, we still don't have N7 emojis and other classic symbols.

Examples:
- every couple minutes, the game stops responding to most keys, which means you can't get into the menu screen, or any of its sub screens (quest list, squad screen, equipment screen, etc.), only restart fixes it
- the AI is super bad, it isn't all that good in the original either, but here, it's somehow even worse - quite literally getting stuck in the middle of an empty area with no obstacles, not shooting enemies in the open and instead aiming and shooting at enemies behind cover, including shooting at walls when targeting enemies in another room, with closed door, that were never directly spotted
- the textures are absolutely fucked. especially skin of everything that is not Asari, the colors are all weird, some of them are sharper that the original, some of them are left super blurry which makes them clash a lot, Anderson looks like he wanted to get a quick tan, but didn't have the money for a vacation, so he stuck his head into an oven and fell asleep for a couple hours, Udina looks like he fucking died at least a week ago, his skin looks like it's about to enter the final stage of rotting, and I guarantee you that there is no actual human, in the actual real world, who has the skincolor of either of them, at least not naturally and while alive
- female Shepard's face is F U C K E D, like really fucking bad - it has been made appropriate for modern audiences, which means someone opened the model file and set the chin size to double what the in-game slider allows - or maybe it's simply because of how bad the textures are, that makes it seem like that. Default Shepard was never a beauty (the engine didn't even allow it really), but this malformed abomination is way way way worse.
- lighting is even more fucked than the textures, the in-built HDR is absolute ass, every light source is brightened into retina destroying levels, colors are all kinds of screwed up - how anyone managed to fuck HDR this bad, I have no fucking idea - it took several restarts and fucking with settings for 10 minutes on top of that to actually turn it off because it refuses to simply be disabled and will fucking fight for its right to burn out your eyes

I also encountered a bunch of old bugs from the original game, so whomever did this ""upgrade"" basically just ducktaped a shitty HDR system to it, edited an .ini file to allow higher resolutions than the original retail release got, and here we are - ""The definitive way to play Mass Effect!""

The Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition brings one of gaming’s most iconic trilogies back to life, but unfortunately, the remaster fails to live up to the “legendary” status of its name. While the core games are still fantastic experiences in terms of story and character development, the remaster itself feels underwhelming and misses the opportunity to modernize the series in meaningful ways.

The most noticeable improvement is the visual overhaul, but even this feels inconsistent. While certain environments and character models look stunning, other aspects—like facial animations or some textures—still feel dated. The updates to Mass Effect 1 are welcome, particularly the improved controls and UI, but the changes don't go far enough to fix its clunky combat and awkward mechanics. For a remaster, the visual and gameplay upgrades are serviceable but hardly groundbreaking.

Another issue is the lack of meaningful new content. Beyond graphical updates and quality-of-life changes, there’s little to justify revisiting the trilogy for those who have already played the original games. The exclusion of the multiplayer mode from Mass Effect 3 is also disappointing, as it was a fun and engaging addition to the original release that added replay value.

The Legendary Edition also suffers from technical problems. Frame rate dips, occasional bugs, and inconsistent audio quality break immersion and serve as reminders that this is, at its core, a remaster of older games rather than a true modernization. It’s especially frustrating when these issues arise in a collection that was marketed as the definitive way to experience the trilogy.

Perhaps the biggest missed opportunity is the lack of innovation in gameplay. The combat systems in Mass Effect 2 and 3 feel relatively smooth, but they’ve aged noticeably. The clunky cover mechanics and repetitive enemy encounters remind players that these are games from a different era. The remaster does little to bring these aspects up to modern standards, which may alienate newcomers to the series.

In the end, Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition is still worth playing for those who’ve never experienced the trilogy, as the story, characters, and world-building remain among the best in gaming. However, as a remaster, it feels like a missed opportunity to truly elevate the series. For returning fans, the lack of meaningful changes and the dated feel of the gameplay may leave you wondering if the nostalgia was better left untouched.",1734804766,1734804766,False,2,0,0.5440729856491088,0,True,False,False,False,1328670,20250114_132033,negative,100

Original review - 29 minutes of playtime

Mass Effect is great. I've heard that LE is also a great version of the trilogy. However, I haven't been able to get past the EA launcher yet.

Update - 26 hours of playtime

Yeah, the game's good. The launcher is just unreliable. it's a fight every time to get this game to launch so I keep my sessions long. At least the issue is in the launcher / service, which has better chances of getting fixed than the game. I have conflicting feelings on whether I should turn this review positive.

Update - 68 hours of playtime

My cons would mainly be the endgame which can feel tedious at times, and punishing to a point where it is not hard, but simply annoying : 
- single try pinnacle bosses is lame, it forces you mostly to go on youtube and spoil yourself to learn the boss before even trying, because it took you X hours to farm for your single try and of course, you don't want to waste this chance.

- Waystones favorites has to be in the game.

- Tedious layouts on certain specific maps (yes I'm talking about you, Mire and Hidden Grotto, just to name two).

- Waystones sustain feels off, you start with a strong feeling where you are having a hard time doing you atlas talents, and end up with almost too much waystones even without notable nodes increasing their drop chance (which would be fixed with a waystone tab anyway).

- Allow us, in any way, to navigate our passive skill tree more easily. You’ve blocked the middle of the tree, which caters too much to what your class can do. If you want to play a ranger summoner, you would have to waste 10, 15, or even 20 levels just to reach the summoning nodes. Maybe ""gate"" nodes who would teleport you somewhere else could be a good idea to navigate the tree with fewer wasted talent points.

- I will not talk about drop rate, items balancing, class buffs and nerfs, as it is still an EA and easily fixable because it comes down only to numbers. Exept for one thing : ITEM RARITY ON GEAR HAS TO BE DELETED. Simple as that.
It is mind numbing to know that it affects not only gear drop rates, but also CURRENCY drop rates. It should come from ""juicing"" your waystones, towers and atlas passives. The current state of this precise stat, catters you way too much and sends you into FOMO mode if you don't run it on your character. Even 100% rarity, which is low compared to some, is night and day.

- Crafting needs to be implemented better and in a more polished way. For the moment, if you are new and poor, it comes down to gambling by using your exalts and praying you'll have a good modifier. The ""real"" crafting comes with omens, which cost an arm and a leg, and is a priviledge unlocked only for those who can spend tons of currency to buy them.

- Please GGG, try to work and developp the PoE Trade website directly into the game. We shouldn't have to go out of our way so often outside of the game to sell and buy what we want. The currency exchange is a huge step in the right direction.

Aside from perfomances, a few crashes and what I wrote above, I'm having a blast.

I love having big maps and taking my time to carefully maneuver enemies as they are more threatening than it's predecessor, where even from the start you could 1 or 2 click clear the screen out of them with little to no effort. 

I love the game being slower paced and handling you resources you can eventually learn and rightfully implement in your arsenal rather than having everything shoved down your throat in a couple hours.

I love the QoL changes such as being able to refund passive points without needing to reroll a character or passing hours on the internet looking for the perfect build to follow religiously.

[h1][b][u]Path of Exile 2[/u][/b][/h1]

Prior to this Early Access, I played around 70 hours on the original game, give or take a few dramatic rage quits, and let’s just say my experience wasn’t exactly award-winning. 

Most of the time, it felt less like I was controlling my character and more like I was a hyperactive cheerleader with no rhythm, waving pom-poms from the sidelines. Naturally, I cycled through a bunch of different classes, took some extended coffee breaks (read: months), and came back as clueless as ever. Long story short, I am, from my perspective, still a certified noob while playing both games. Sure, my wins early on, here, felt somewhat like actual wins, but I can’t shake the feeling that the game is secretly prepping me for failure all over again.

And oh, what wasn’t I wrong about that!

Fast forward to Path of Exile 2. I hit a wall midway through Act 1 with my first character. Naturally, I chose the same class I played in the original game. True to form, I ignored every single warning sign, like a signaler on an airfield, that I was completely botching my build. This led to a character that couldn’t even take down the King in the Mist. Many wasted uncut gems and support gems later, the cost of fixing my mistakes were greater than my entire retirement plan. In the end, I did what any self-respecting gamer would do: I rerolled and Googled [url=https://deltiasgaming.com/a-comprehensive-guide-about-the-witch-class-in-path-of-exile-2/] Witch Class for Dummies [/url], and got offered the holy grail, [url=https://maxroll.gg/poe2/build-guides/minion-army-infernalist-leveling-guide#skills-header] the Infernalist minion build [/url], which looked like the magical path for Act 1 to 3, or at least, that is what I thought!

Hoping this time I wouldn’t end up with a character that needs an exorcist, I dove back in and climbed my way up, passing through the areas I had previously flailed around in. I Finally reached Freythorn once again killing the mobs here with ease, and, to my absolute delight, managed to kill the bastard that previously kept crushing my sanity into oblivion fairly fast.

Pushing further into The Ogham areas, I noticed the difficulty spike once again. Near the end, it seemed like I was trapped in a personal torture chamber, and the Executioner definitely felt like he was auditioning to be my lifelong nemesis. What felt like an eternal struggle, I learned that I had to tweak my build a bit better, and he finally dropped dead. To my surprise, he left me my very first spirit gem. I used it to craft my Raging Spirit skill, and suddenly the game stopped bullying me, at least for now. It finally seemed like I had made a good choice with this build.

Maybe, just maybe, I was finally upgrading from clueless newbie to a real Exile.

Or maybe not, not just yet! Stepping into Ogham Manor was like entering a haunted house where the ghosts didn’t just jump-scare me, they burned my resources and kept me busy for a while. The guide I was following? Yeah, turns out it was more of a polite suggestion than the bulletproof strategy I thought it was. At first, everything was peachy; I was smashing mobs left and right, feeling like a legend. But then, this area decided to take things to another level.

The mobs got angrier, swarming me like mosquitoes at a camping trip. They rushed me, shoved me around, interrupted my spells, and just when I thought I could escape, BOOM! I was blown to smithereens. One mob exploded, another yanked the rug out from under me, and before I knew it, I was sprawled on the floor, defeated by regular mobs, hah, what a joke right?

Moving onward, I shuffled in and out of the manor to offload my loot that seemed to multiply like rabbits! Finally, I reached The Mad Wolf. He wasn’t here to play fetch. It was a wake-up call that the gloves were off. Either I stuck it out or admitted defeat with my tail between my legs.

What followed was a parade of deaths so ridiculous it could’ve been its own blooper reel. I tinkered endlessly with my gem skills, fine-tuned my gear with whatever scraps I had, and squinted at the boss mechanics like I was cramming for an exam. Every defeat nudged me a little closer, teaching me something new, like the fact that this wolf really hated me.

And then, finally, sweet victory! The boss fell to my last desperate blow, leaving me in a state of disbelief, as if I’d just stumbled upon a hidden treasure of everlasting glory.

I wouldn’t say the game is impossible, but it definitely has a “mess up and prepare to be roasted” vibe. It’s like the game’s saying, “You think you’ve got this? Watch me teach you humility!” While not everything is spoon-fed to you, there’s a whole community ready to hand you a metaphorical cup of coffee and help you figure out your build. You stumble, you adapt, and eventually, you’ll reach the point where you will be winning your fights. 

And honestly? That’s the kind of challenge I expect from every game I play!

📜 SIDE NOTES:

[code][b]⭐ For me the WASD and the added roll/dodge were a must for me to pull me into this genre.
⭐ Positioning, and reactive reflexes are very important, without them you will surely die!!
⭐ The lack of in depth knowledge en understanding boosts community interaction. ...
⭐ Visuals and voice acting are from the highest quality, they nailed it in this game.

I never expected myself to enjoy this type of game, but the Early Access drew me right in![/b] [/code]
[code][b]⚠️ While I believe this game is more accessible to a larger audience, it may still not be for everyone, particularly due to its steep difficulty, challenging learning curve, and significant time investment required. If you're not prepared to dedicate considerable effort to mastering the mechanics and overcoming tough challenges, it might be best to wait for the free version before committing![/b] [/code]
[code][b]📢 As this is an Early Access release, updates by the developers are inevitable, and my experience is likely to change as I advance beyond the first Act. Accordingly, this blog will be updated over time![/b] [/code]

There are some hurdles to enjoying the experience though.  Please read the following guides below to avoid some of those hurdles:

- How to use weapon sets and allocation points in POE 2.
- How to use a controller and mouse simultaneously in POE 2.
- How to build a POE 2 skill tree as a strength/block character.
- How to make the most of POE 2 trade time / down time / town time.

1. Weapon Swapping and Assigning Weapon Set Allocation Points Guide:

You do not have to press a button to swap weapons. In order to swap weapons: First, press ""O"" to assign the inputs you want to use for your skills under ""input."" Next in order to assign the skill you want to use to a weapon set press ""G"" then click the arrow to the right of the skill.  A window will pop out to the right. At the bottom of that new window there will be weapon set check boxes. They are both checked by default (a strange choice). Just un-check the box for the weapon you aren't using for each skill. Finally, after you've un-chosen a weapon set for each of your skills, close the skill menu. Now assign your skills to different inputs by left clicking the squares in the lower right side of the screen and then left clicking the icon for the corresponding skill you want on that button. Pushing the assigned input button (shown under the squares in the lower right) will now automatically swap to that corresponding weapon set (the box you left checked earlier) and use that skill.

Second, after you earn some weapon set allocations, if you decide to allocate some your passive skill points to different nodes for use with different weapon sets you need to have both skill points and weapon set allocations to spend. You know if you have skill points by pressing the ""p"" key to bring up your passive tree; your skill point number is the number in the very upper right corner of that screen. Your weapon allocation points are the two numbers under the skill point number.  If the skill point number or the weapon allocation number are zero, then you cannot assign anything to that weapon set at the moment. Don't worry - you can respec skill points if you decide to use your allocations later. The weapon set allocations allow you to spend 1 skill point in two different passive tree locations by having a skill point and then left clicking the arrow to the left of the words ""weapon set"" then clicking a passive node. You can only do this if you have positive weapon allocations for that weapon set AND positive skill points. IMPORTANT: For some reason currently these allocations can NOT be used to allocate jewel socket nodes (jewel sockets are empty looking nodes on the passive tree where you can slot jewel items that have stats.)

2. How to Use a Controller and Mouse Simultaneously in POE 2 Guide:

If you are playing on Steam, there is a 4th hidden control method that is actually THE BEST method for controlling you character. First select the WASD input method in POE 2 then alt tab.  With your controller plugged in and turned on, if you are looking at POE 2 in your Steam library, there will be a controller button on the right hand side, under the POE 2 banner image. This button allows you to override each steam game's default controller scheme.  Dont worry you can press the button again to turn off the changes at anytime if you dont like them.  After you click the button, under Recommended Layouts - select ""Keyboard (WASD) and Mouse."" Then remap Left Trigger to Space Bar so you can use it to roll dodge in game. You can do this by clicking ""Edit Layout"" then ""Triggers,"" then, on the right side, next to Left Trigger make Full Pull = Space Bar and Soft Pull = Space Bar. This whole process will effectively make your controller be detected as an additional keyboard/mouse. You can now use the left joystick to control your character and left trigger to dodge roll in game while simultaneously using your mouse and mouse buttons to aim and use abilities. You can also pick up items, mange inventory, and use skills/skill menus with your mouse and use controller to move/roll without logging out to switch control types.

3. One Way To Build A Strength/Block Character in POE 2 Guide:

While looking at skill tree, in the upper right hand corner utilize the ""Search here"" box to find nodes on the tree.  From Warrior or Mercenary Starting Area to ""Giant's Blood.""  Take ""Cruel Methods"" and ""Pile On.""  From Warrior or Mercenary starting area to ""Colossal Weapon."" From ""Colossal Weapon"" to ""Unexpected Finesse."" ""Unexpected Finesse"" to ""Polymathy."" ""Polymathy"" to ""Iron Reflexes.""  Now, in the upper right hand corner where it says ""Search here,"" type ""Strength"" Path to any/some/all of the glowing nodes in southwest section of the skill tree.  Type ""Block"" in the same search bar and path to any/some/all glowing nodes in the southwest of skill tree.  See next paragraph for skills and gear.

Skills/Gear.  Left Click with Armour Breaker – Linked with Armour Explosion, Demolisher, and Martial Tempo.  Then Right Click with Sunder – Linked with Heavy Swing, Heft, and Super Critical.  Hat/Gloves/Belt – Resistances, Life, Strength.  Body – High Armor/Strength and Resistances.  Rings/Amulet – Resistances, life/strength, at least one with 5% mana leech.  Weapon – Any Cultist Greathammer, Advanced Cultist Greathammer or Expert Cultist Greathammer. Must have plus to ""Level of all Melee Skills"" and plus some type of ADDED and/or % physical damage. Other damage or some attack speed is nice but not required.  Shield – Some Armor and the ""Life gained when you Block"" enchant stat or the Recover % Life on Block stat.  Boots - Movement Speed / Resists

4. POE 2 Trade Time / Down time / Town Time Guide:

Respecing costs more as you level. Try to keep some gold on you to respec several points.

If you see a item with percent quality on it and/or an item with a socket in it, even if it's not good, pick it up to salvage it later. Also, if you see one of these in the store for a reasonable amount of gold from a vendor - purchase it to salvage. You'll get shards that you can use for upgrading gear and trading at the currency exchange market later on.

Finally, you can ""disenchant"" rare items for regal orb shards in town at a npc. It is ""hidden"" as one of the dialog options. (strange choice)  Unique items become chance shards if you ""disenchant"" them at the npc. Most unique items will be worth more to other players though - so I recommend you save them - wait for a GGG point shop stash tab sale and then buy one currency tab and one premium quad tab with your early access shop points (you can right click premium tabs in your stash and then make public for trading with other players, within the tab, you can right click items to list your items for orbs on the poe2 homepage trade search section).  The trade search on the POE 2 homepage can also be used to find gear for your builds.  For example for the Strength build above you would type ""Strength"" under Stat Filters then pick one, add a minimum value then search.

After over 100 hours I can say that I recommend this game as an Early Access ARPG. I love a lot about this game and I'm a PoE fanboy so I'll be objective and take off my rose tinted glasses.

While the game has some pain points with the permanence of ""choice"" and does not subscribe to the industry standard of ""Loot Piñatas,"" it is beautiful, vibrant, haunting, and provides something ""different"" from any other ARPG. 

There's fun to be had in experimentation but the wrong choice for gear or skill points could make you feel that time was wasted. Ascendancy trials are TERRIBLE and while on paper sound fun, are deep ball pain to attempt. Ascendancy ultimately only provides a different way to play and do not dictate the CORE of your build. I suggest waiting to complete the trials until you're SURE of what you want to do and be VERY CAREFUL in your choice of Ascendancy.

I'm aware of the nerfs and I demand justice for my fellow Exiles in the form of a free respec. As an Early Access game it should not be outlandish to provide one and it hurts me knowing people are frustrated by something they literally couldn't control. Sending my love.

I'll update again once I've put in more time or more updates happen.


ORIGINAL POST - 

Positive review to balance all the idiots who are leaving negatives for launch day issues and for just generally trying to bomb the game. I don't think reviews should be available for early access games because you really aren't getting a fair view of what the game will actually provide so I find it laughable that people can definitively just say ""good"" or ""bad.""

It hasn't launched fully. First day of server issues are nothing out of the ordinary for game releases. The highest player count on PoE1 was over 200k.

This is a bird view Dark Souls-esque Game. The Idea is that while you level and equip your Character traditionally to older ARPGs, Bossfights (which happen constantly) are about you learning the Phases, dodging and avoiding everything. The Damage Output is very high, so one shot deaths or almost one shot deaths are very common.  You will not just chill on the couch, deal AE damage and clear the areas, you will definitely have to focus, learn and adapt to encounters. The first real Gatekeeper will be the Act1 Boss and I fear that many Casual Players will not go beyond that.

It's essential to understand how support and skill gems work and the effect they trigger when combined with each-other and with passives at the same time. You need a gameplan basically.

Once it ""clicked"" for me, the experience changed quite a bit. Not hard or tedious at all as some people is trying to convey, but fair and well balanced instead.
You need to squeeze the damage, or desired effects, out of your skill slots as much as you can.

Experiment as much as you can (support gems can be moved freely), it's fun and rewarding.
Of course it is also important to upgrade/change weapons/armor and the skills you intend to use as soon as you can.

Graphics are stunning, the atmosphere is superb (I would even go as far as to say it's better than D4), music is fantastic and the slower gameplay with more weight and tactical focus on skills and builds is a refreshing thing to see in the genre.

Sure, some bosses will literally wipe the floor with you, and that's where you stop, rethink your build/strategy and go again (and this comes from someone who never liked ""soul-like"" games)

To succinctly summarise my overall feeling: The PoE 2 campaign is excellent, but ascension is f*n ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that needs a complete overhaul, and the end game is unrewarding enough to not be worth my time. To elaborate:

[b]First some praise:[/b]
[list]
[*] Graphics, splash screens, audio, and voice acting are top notch.
[*] Besides the constant crashing, it runs well (though I do have a very nice PC, so not a hard feat)
[*] I deeply appreciate my stash tabs being transferred over from PoE1 and anticipate many of my aesthetic microtransactions will be too at a later date.
[*] I love being able to play with WASD instead of mouse click move. This makes running and casting spells a lot easier and just feels good.
[*] I love that the skills have been delinked from the gear, meaning I no longer have to worry about getting/crafting the right amount and colour of linked sockets every time I find better gear.
[/list]


NOW TIME FOR BITTER COMPLAINTS:


[b]No Blink Spells[/b]
I like the dodge roll, but not at the expense of no blink spells. I can live with this change, but honestly, I prefer my flame dash and frost blink to unlimited dodge rolls.

[b]Slow Pace[/b]
The bosses being beefy are fine, but the normal mobs have a little too much HP. Makes map clearing a bit tedious. It's already a lot slower without the blink spells, but now having to go through areas and maps slowly hacking through enemies instead of breezing through and making them regret their life choices does not give me the dopamine-fueled hero vibe I had in PoE1.

[b]Level Gated Skills[/b]
The gem variety seems a lot more level gated than before and the manner in which you level them, even more so. I much prefer the way it worked in PoE1. I also can't believe that I'm at the maps already and still working with only 4 links. In PoE1, I would have at least had a 5 link by the time I got to the atlas.

[b]Melee Sucks[/b]
The warrior attacks are SO slow. I've tried all the classes and this is the most unfun to play mostly because the attacks take an age to build up. As a warrior I expect to feel like I can rush in and slap things around, but he gets slapped around by everything before he can even get there to land the first hit.

[b]Lack of Loot and unfair Gambling[/b]
Compared to PoE1, there's not nearly as much loot. I like loot. You like loot. Everyone likes loot, but we get so little loot in PoE2, we don't even really need a loot filter. That's not only a shame because I'm GLOAT (greatest looter of all time), and an avid SSF player, but it also means progression is even slower due to to poor gear choices and not enough currency to do anything about it.

It becomes an even bigger issue with the sorceress and witch. If I embrace a certain skill attached to a specific staff/wand, it means that I can only use that specific staff/wand and all other types are useless for me. 60% of the time, after levelling up, the merchants did not sell that type of staff/wand I was using, and the only time their loot refreshes is on level up, so I have to go through a whole level before I can hope for the right staff/wand to appear in the merchants wares again because they mostly did not drop in game either (due to hardly any loot generally).

The gambling is unfair as well. With both witches and sorceresses, a wand or staff that does not have the spell you are using is absolutely useless but you can only gamble for a random staff which could have other spells you aren't using. Out of every 10 staves, I get maybe 2 of the kind that I actually want, and they're typically poor quality with stupid mods like ""light radius"" or ""lower requirements"".

[b]Ascension[/b]
Ultimatum and Sanctum can eat a whole bag of dix. Next to that necro whatever league recently, they are the worst mechanics from PoE1 ever, but at least there I could ignore it. In PoE2 they've been used for Ascension so I'm forced to interact with it. There was nothing wrong with how ascension worked in PoE1. Not sure why GGG had to reinvent the wheel. I miss Izaro. I happened to enjoy Ascension from PoE1. This new ascension method is not only horribly difficult (could not get past the third stage of chaos whilst being 10 levels higher), but the invites keep dropping at the level my character is at, so I can't get brutally overpowered and do them eventually. THIS IS NOT FAIR. Of course the sweatlords will put out a meta build and then a bunch of people will copy that verbatim and then feel like they achieved something on their own by getting through it, and and then have the gall to scream 'skill issue' at anyone that complains, but if ascension is only going to be for sweatlords and sweatlord build copiers, then I'll go back to PoE1, thanks.


[b]Atlas[/b]
The end game has no sense of direction. The thing that keeps me playing PoE1 is the mini achievements and milestones all along the way. My progression speed starts to taper off on the high level corrupted red maps and the game stops being fun and becomes a boring grind. It's at this point that I typically drop off PoE1. I'm sure telemetry data will show this is the case for many players. In PoE 2 it's even worse. I got to tier 1 maps, unlocked a hideout and now I have no desire to continue. The lack of loot (gear and currency) and slower progression are just boring for me.


After all that complaining I'm still giving the game a thumbs up because it will be free and I also supsect that GGG will make some changes to fix at least some of that. I hope my constructive feedback will be considered by the devs. I'm not the best player. I don't do meta or trading, but I do have almost 2k hours playing SSF in PoE1 (and loving it), so I'm not a noob either. So I hope this feedback will be seen as coming from 'your average player and fan'.",1733519191,1735750274,True,6,0,0.576132595539093,0,False,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,positive,100

If this would be the full release it would clearly be a NO for me.

First of all, I never witnessed a game manage to crash and freez a pc to the point it needs to be shutdown with the powerbutton.

In my opinon the Early Access got way to much attention that hopefully don't end up taxing on the full release.

Moving all the mobility spells into the mid to lategame is such a bad idea, making monster pile up on the player with the only option to panic spam space in hope to escape.

Some Abilitys wind-up way to long making the player stagnate on one position for atleast 1s, while the monster move at 1,5x the speed of the player having enough time to cancel the players wind-up or make it impossible to not take damage.

Monster most of the time aggro offscreen independent of line of sight or elevation levels.
Lots of bodyblock, monster bodyblocking themself, players bodyblocking themself in multiplayer

a lot of maps are just squares with narrow bridges or big maps filled with so many details that its hard to understand what is accessible and what not

Gear progression is also pushed into lategame and without trading I still would walk around with my lv 33 boots at level 60+ cause they rolled good stats and making a new pair with the same stats would cost more then the game is giving to the player.

Bosses are fun to fight but most of the time they make big damage moves without indicator or they do a 1 shot ability with a save location, but at the same time the boss cast a second ability on the only save spot the player can stand.

Spirit is a great change to mana reservation making it way more manageable.

The new gem system also pushes all progression into lategame and gives little room to improve in the first acts.

For example, I found a better version of the staff I got at the start that gives me a fireball spell and as my secondary I have another staff that shoots out a spread of 7 ice projectiles that can freeze enemies, but I could have any other weapon my attributes allow me to equip if I wanted. I also like the uncut gem system of using one of those uncut gem items to make a new spell/skill gem or upgrade one you already have.

It all adds up to a lot of different options to approach combat and make it feel more fun than most other games in the genre because of the way the different skills/spells work together and how it encourages using a 2nd weapon set in ways others never really have. I've always made my main weapon set and had a 2nd equipped, but never use it. Here, I do constantly. In part cause it's offering more ways to deal out different types of damage in different ways, but also in part because of how they interplay with each other. The flame wall I didn't think I was gonna use cause they don't end up feeling that useful in these kinds of games is how I now handle a certain skeleton that likes hiding behind his shield that reflects my spells in a most painful way. He not only doesn't like standing on it anymore than other enemies do, but firing projectiles thru it gets fire damage added to them, meaning my shotgun blast of ice shards also deals fire damage if it passes thru that.

The way my fireball spell builds up the stun meter on bosses so that I can deal a ton of damage to them while they're stunned or my ice spells can build up enough freeze on them to do the same while they're frozen makes both options feel more viable. I usually don't mess around with those kinds of mechanics-at least not while playing a mage or sorcerer style class in these kinds of games-but here it feels totally viable. Sure, I'm not very far in the game yet and have died multiple times, but it's pretty much always been due to mistakes I knew I made and feels both fair and justified the vast majority of the time-with the others honestly being me getting stuck in parts of the environment I should have been paying attention to and not getting myself backed into corners.

I also feel like they did a good job of making a game with fewer, but more impactful enemies-rather than spamming you with a bunch of trash mobs you can instantly clear off the screen peppered with a few tougher enemies here and there that might take a second or 2 longer to kill than the trash mobs. It feels slower paced than I remember the first one being and maybe even most others in the genre, but it also balances that out by being more fun to fight groups of enemies, mini bosses, bosses, and generally engage with any of the combat related content. It may devolve into it at some point where I just end up spamming one or 2 main abilities/spells that kill everything with only needing to use the other spells/abilities on the occasional time I get into trouble, but at least for now, I feel like I'm using more tools in my arsenal to take down the different groups of enemies. In part because it feels fun to switch between my 2 weapons and how they attack and the damage they deal, but because I tend to need to. The frost lets me freeze enemies to get the breathing room to blow them up with my fireball and the firewall and lightning deals damage over time while they're trying to catch back up to me if they survived the fireball blasts to the face.

I know it's going to be free to play in 6 months or so when it leave early access, but I played a lot of the first one and I don't think I tossed them so much as a buck during all that time. I felt quite comfortable throwing them $30 now to check the game out early and help fund it while they finish the rest of the content. Speaking of, it looks like there are only 6 classes so far with each showing another coming soon and when you use the uncut skill gems, you see that flails, axes, swords, primal, and a few more are also coming soon. Don't let that discourage you from checking out the game, though. I haven't seen any of those things drop so far in the game, so I could be wrong, but it's just more stuff that's going to be added as they further develop the game rather than being something that's partially in the game without skills to use to make them more fun. Sure, that means things like axes and swords aren't in yet (they could be and I just haven't seen them), but it means that all the stuff you're seeing so far if you've watched any videos or people streaming/playing the game is BEFORE they added flails, axes, and the related skills to offer even more ways to play the game and make different builds for your characters.

I was a little worried that picking a class this time would more heavily restrict me from playing the game how I want, but aside from not having whatever Spirit is that's needed to cast the undead minion summoning spells that I assume the Witch class has to start off with to use those, I don't see any restrictions to what my class/character can use/do. Well, the Attributes I have impact that as well, but you can alter those thru the passive skill tree like always.

If you wanna check out the game earlier than normal and help support the developers and this game, then I recommend getting one of the supporter packs. Otherwise, there's likely no harm in waiting until it leaves early access and goes true free to play next year. I didn't want to wait and am glad I didn't cause this is probably the most fun combat in the genre right now, but that's just my opinion. If I end up getting bored with the sorceress class and their spells, I already scoped out the Mercenary class and their crossbows with different types of ammunition that make it act like a shotgun, long range rifle, or rapid fire ranged weapon in addition to the different types of ammunition that deal different types of elemental damage seems like a lot of fun, too.

Before recommending the game, it's worth noting the PoE fan base is a bit cancerous. It is very similar to Steam/Valve fans where nothing negative can be said about the game, or the vocal fan base gets extremely defensive whether passive aggressively or straight up aggressive. 

With that said, if you ignore the toxic fan base by not interacting with them, you have a mutation/baby of the following games:

Monster Hunter
Soulsborne (Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne)
Lost Ark
Grim Dawn
Diablo 2

And the result is beautiful. The game rewards you for mechanically understanding how not to get hit, and returning the pain but also forces you to learn how to build (aka. have a long term goal/plan.) The target audience for this game would likely be a fan of any of the above games. The learning curve, however, is sharp, especially if you are melee. The build learning curve, thankfully, is much less insane than PoE1 due to the removal of gem links on items (thank god.)

If you are Diablo 4 player and found D4's end game extremely lacking, you will find PoE2 not only looks better than D4, it has a far more fleshed out endgame than D4 despite being in EA.

I've heard the comparison ""a mix between diablo and Elden ring"" thrown around which is exactly my thoughts. It is challenging and not for the faint of heart, but by god i'm in love with this game. 
It is much easier to pick up and play than poe1, you don't need a spreadsheet and a build guide to get you going.
There are some issues with the maps being insanely large and backtracking is not always fun. Currency is a little scarce, but these are all issues GGG are working on, and i see this game going on to be the best ever ARPG ever, and for me its not even close.

[b]Story: 4/10[/b]
The storyline in Path of Exile 2 isn't anything great. It's just something there so you may have some kind of explanation for fighting monsters. Most often, one would just let it be and enjoy the game play - since that matters most here. You will utterly be disappointed in this game if you're on a story power trip.

[b]Graphics: 8.5/10[/b]
It really looks great. Dark and detailed environments, incredible spell effects-the atmosphere of every area is gloomy and pulls you in. Animations are smooth, and everything feels polished visually. If your PC can handle it, it's a treat for the eyes.

[b]Optimization: 6/10[/b]
Performance is an issue right now. I've had multiple crashes at random moments, be it during boss fights, loading screens, or just running around. It's frustrating, especially when you're deep into a fight. Hopefully, the developers fix this soon, as it really breaks the flow of the game. We will have to wait for the full release to make the final decision here.

[b]Progression System: 9/10[/b]
Amazing progression system in PoE2, giant skill tree with huge customization options, and this gem system is just fantastic, adding a whole another level to it. Will definitely be overwhelming at first, but when one gets used to it, it is incredibly satisfying. You will always have something you'd like to change or work on, so it feels fresh. 

[b]Combat Mechanics: 10/10[/b]
It's far and away the best part of this game. Currently, I am maining the Infernalist, an Ascendancy class of the Witch. The combos of spells are amazing, really. You commit to one element as an Infernalist, and mine is fire. The synergies between AoE Spells, Minions, and Fire Resistance reduction AoE are incredible. So dynamic in combat. You can set everything on fire, summon minions to do your bidding, and debuff enemies to melt them even faster. Adding in the dodge roll really changes the pace of combat; you're not just standing there, spamming abilities, you're moving around, dodging attacks, and repositioning to deal damage. It makes every fight way more skill-based and keeps you on your toes. Abilities hit hard, and controls feel tight and responsive so that when you land a big spell or pull off a perfect combo, it feels incredibly satisfying. Clearing mobs or going toe-to-toe with bosses, every fight feels like an engaging and rewarding fight.

[b]Grinding: 8/10[/b]
It's a huge part of the game, and it's done well. It feels really rewarding to find just the right item, even when RNG can sometimes drive you crazy. Hence, you need to grind for crafting and upgrading materials a lot since you will lose a lot of your lovely gear to RNG system :(. But still, you will find a +8/10 gear eventually and make your dream build with it. So, the grinding system for me is a solid 8/10. It's great but still needs a bit of work and might change drastically after full game release.

[b]Endgame Content: 7/10[/b]
Once you complete the campaign, PoE2 boasts a huge and challenging endgame. Maps are classified into 16 tiers; the difficulty scales up real fast as you progress, where enemies become more formidable in every way, including higher elemental resistances. And this means you will continually be upgrading your own resistances to keep up. But here’s the frustrating part : while enemies gain resistances, your character's elemental resistances are often drastically reduced, making it harder to survive in the later tiers. It's one of those mechanics that feels more like an artificial difficulty spike than an interesting challenge. You’re essentially forced into tweaking your gear constantly just to survive in higher-tier maps, which can be pretty annoying. You spend a lot of time dealing with this imbalance, and it feels like it just adds unnecessary grind rather than strategic depth.
Besides the maps, significant endgame content is provided by the Trials of Chaos and Sekhemas. You only need to complete four rooms in the Trials of Chaos to get the Ascendancy points, but you can challenge yourself even more by going up to room 10, which is true endgame content. These trials are made for up to six players, making sure it's a very cooperative experience, really putting to the test your skills and teamwork. Difficulty ramps up significantly, but the rewards are quite worth the effort, therefore making this aspect of the game both exciting and challenging.

[b]Overall Score: 9/10[/b]
PoE2 is an excellent ARPG. The combat feels amazing, the progression system is deep, and the grind is addictive. The crashes and weak story do hold it back a bit, but its still a great experience overall. The full release will likely improve the game further, especially with better optimization and possibly some tweaks to the endgame. If you're willing to push through some rough edges for now, it's definitely worth playing. We’ll have to wait until the full release to see how much it improves, but for early access, it’s already very promising.",1733934378,1735569829,True,3,0,0.5634920597076416,0,True,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,positive,100

Clocked 1200+ hours on it and loved playing it for years, until I eventually stopped, mostly due to two main issues:
[list]
[*]Years of adding league mechanics into the core game made it extremely bloated, to a point where returning to the game required grinding through every mechanic from zero, over and over again, which just felt terrible.
[*]It felt bad to play the game casually while being aware of builds which allowed you to zoom through maps and delete whole screens of mobs in a split second. The game became too much of an epilepsy simulator, relying on major dopamine hits. It became too fast, where not using Whirling Blades or other movement skills constantly was a major disadvantage; without them you couldn’t farm currency quickly enough to buy build-enabling chase items.
[/list]
To my relief, these issues were resolved PoE2: there are fewer side mechanics (for now) and the game has slowed down. I am playing monk and I’m currently in Act 2 and absolutely love the synergy of skills, of movement and different effects. I don’t feel punished for taking my sweet time listening to NPCs, fighting mobs and enjoying the intensity of combat.

Other things I appreciate:
[list]
[*]WASD controls turned out to be super fun, makes me much more engaged and immersed in the game.
[*]The game is visually and aurally beautiful.
[*]It is much more difficult than PoE1 in its early acts; with its roll mechanics often described as Souls-like. Meanwhile, studying and recognizing boss patterns makes just enough difference to turn a hopeless fight into a win. With addition of checkpoints, dying is not as punishing as in PoE1 and minimizes frustration from dying to a boss multiple times.
[*]Skill gems system was reworked and is an upgrade in every way to PoE1, where it was normal to have dozens of useless gems. Getting a 5-link chest armor ASAP was always a major pain, not to mention 6-linking your best-in-slot chest in the endgame.
[*]The most common complaint I’ve seen so far is that PoE2 is too slow. It is exactly what an ARPG needs to actually enjoy the encounters with monsters of different rarities. Encounters are now more impactful, whereas it was expected in PoE1 to delete a rare monster in 2 hits, making it’s suffixes and effects meaningless.
[/list]
Some of my concerns:
[list] 
[*]When the remaining 6 classes are added, it will further dilute the item drop pool (atm there are no swords, axes, daggers, javelins, etc.). I hope GGG will add a preferential loot drop for the class you play, as it is already difficult to find upgrades for your character.
[*]While PoE2 already assists the player more in figuring out the build without consulting external resources, it would be good to be able to “wishlist” or highlight the passive tree nodes that you wish to unlock in the future. This was the best part of Path of Building, which I hope I won't have to use for PoE2, but without it I must remember where I need to go in the tree every time I level up.
[*]GGG said the crafting currency would drop more often to incentivize the player to use it for crafting. This doesn’t seem to be the case; the drop should be increased.
[*]Players with no prior experience may be lost as to what to pick in the passive tree, what direction to take with their characters. Ascendancies give that direction, so seeing them earlier at character select screen would help players understand what stats and attributes to focus on from the get-go.

It's slower-paced, smarter and actually lets you play your build instead of just running a science experiment.

Gone are the days of PoE1’s spreadsheet simulator; this feels like a game again—and a hard one at that. Think “Souls-like” in spirit but still uniquely “Exile-like.” (Can we normalize that as a genre tag?)

It’s early days, but PoE2 is already redefining the genre while looking absolutely stunning. Whether you're here for the lore (yes, it’s shockingly good for an ARPG) or the gameplay, this sequel hits the sweet spot—and maybe breaks your mouse in the process. Highly recommend.

1. Deep Customization
PoE2 offers an incredibly complex skill gem system that allows players to build unique characters with unparalleled customization. In contrast, Diablo IV has a simpler, more streamlined skill tree that might feel restrictive to hardcore RPG fans.

2. Free-to-Play Model
Path of Exile 2, like its predecessor, is free-to-play with optional cosmetic microtransactions. Diablo IV requires an upfront purchase and has a battle pass and in-game shop, which can feel like double-dipping.

3. Skill Gem System
PoE2 revolutionizes its gem system by socketing gems directly into weapons, eliminating a common frustration in PoE1. This change enhances accessibility without sacrificing depth.

4. Regular Updates
Grinding Gear Games (GGG) has a reputation for releasing substantial expansions every three months, keeping the game fresh. Blizzard's slower content release cadence for Diablo IV may feel lackluster in comparison.

5. Advanced Endgame
PoE2 continues PoE's tradition of deep and varied endgame systems, such as maps, bosses, and Atlas customization. Diablo IV’s endgame, while improved, is often criticized for becoming repetitive sooner.

6. Challenging Difficulty
PoE2 is tailored for players seeking hardcore challenges, whereas Diablo IV is designed to appeal to a broader audience, making it less punishing and potentially less rewarding for veterans.

7. Unique Passive Skill Tree
PoE2 retains the massive, intricate passive skill tree from its predecessor, offering near-limitless build possibilities. Diablo IV’s tree, while functional, is comparatively constrained.

8. Economic Depth
PoE2 has a robust in-game economy driven by bartering with various currency items. Diablo IV’s gold-based system lacks the same depth and player-driven dynamics.

9. Two Campaigns
PoE2 allows players to choose between the original campaign and a new one, providing variety and replayability. Diablo IV’s single campaign lacks this option.

10. Class Flexibility
With PoE2's customizable skill gems, any class can effectively use a wide range of skills, whereas Diablo IV ties many abilities directly to specific classes.

11. Community Tools and Integration
The PoE2 community thrives on tools like Path of Building, trade websites, and build guides, creating a collaborative ecosystem. While Diablo IV has fan-made resources, it lacks an equivalent depth of integration.

12. Graphics and Style
PoE2’s graphical overhaul aims for a darker, grittier aesthetic, resonating with fans of classic ARPGs. Diablo IV, while beautiful, has a slightly stylized approach that doesn’t feel as raw.

13. More Frequent Changes
GGG’s willingness to overhaul systems and take risks keeps PoE2 evolving, whereas Blizzard is often conservative with changes, focusing on stability over innovation.",1733527324,1733527324,True,6,0,0.6115869879722595,0,True,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,positive,100

The expanded passive skill trees inspire creativity, enabling players to craft unusual and exciting builds.

Co-op and Endgame
The game stays true to its philosophy of ongoing updates and support. The endgame content is rich with activities, ensuring countless hours of replayability. The co-op experience is seamless, designed for maximum enjoyment with friends. Seasonal events and leagues add layers of excitement and longevity to the game.

Conclusion

A heavily slowed down but massively improved upon sequel to the first game.

My main grip with poe 1? The leveling zones were boring. All of them were 'go from a to b' trying to blast through it as fast as possible. POE 2 fixes this. Boss fights are EXCITING. You can dodge roll, you can attack while moving, you can't just faceplant into a boss over and over until it dies. The areas have optional bosses, worthwhile loot, and visually have a lot of different stuff to explore. Most areas have an entirely unique look and various unique enemies and enemy types.

Ascending, a hassle in poe 1, is a lot more enjoyable as well. It feels like I'm actually playing POE when I'm working on ascending my character, and not a 'avoid a bunch of traps and be bored' simulator like the Lab from poe 1 was.

The music as always is stellar.

The visuals are heavily improved on, to the polish levels of diablo 3 and 4 in terms of animation quality. IMO diablo 3 was the best feeling ARPG in terms of how it 'felt' (not mechanically). POE 2 is now the king of that. The game feels fluid. I can attack/cast while moving. I can dodge roll to avoid attacks. Each skills feels GREAT to use, both on a visual and mechanical level.

Also, poe 2 no longer has messing with gem links, slots, and colors. You just use things. Have fun!

He then looked at their own developing PoE 2 and it's lack of a meaningful endgame content at a time, and started to shift development from campaign toward endgame activities. That happened 3 month before early acess was launched. And that's a perfect descrition of a game right now.

Campaign is fantastic. Every boss is memorable, has a unique moveset that's fun to fight against, often has gimicks and overall just pleasent to look at and fight with. There's a noticible decrease in quality toward the end of act 3, but overall it's more then solid.

Endgame has a good idea, but it's really rough as of right now. From lack of good maps dropping, to endgame bosses requiring you to grind for tens of hours to try to fight them once, with ""key"" item consumed on entry, to ascension dungeons being poorly balanced, to problems with meaningful loot and economy in general, as well as auction being a total junk right now, it's all feels kinda clunky.

Fellow Exiles, isn’t this quite the salient moment? I know thinking clearly is hard right now due to all the hype coursing through our brains, however this is not just an extremely exciting release, it’s genuinely the rebirth of an entire genre! Many are saying that ARPGs are now called Exile-like just to spite some petty losers in another company (you know who you are), but objectively speaking this game really does redefine the entire genre, and I don’t think we’re even fully aware yet of what a momentous thing this is. But let us not waste time on words since the corruption in Wraeclast isn’t going to fight itself, I just want to congratulate the mad lads at Grinding Gear Games for coming this far and making this possible. I have no doubt that an insane amount of work and dedication went into it all, and now, from underdogs in the genre more than a decade ago you arrive at the very top and claim the throne. 

Here's your crown, well deserved! 👑



I know there are also many new souls arriving for this and tasting exile for the first time, and before I myself depart for the cursed shores of Wraeclast again, let me give you a brief overview of what you can expect from this game, so that you can decide easier if you should be playing this and if this is for you as well:

[b]Campaign[/b]
Includes a three-act campaign for early access, with plans to expand to more acts for full release later. I don’t want to spoil anything, I’ll just say it’s very dark, so if you like that kind of atmosphere, you’re gonna love it.


[b]Classes and Ascendancies[/b]
There will be six new and six returning classes, so twelve in total planned for the full release, and at the moment there are six available to play (Witch, Ranger, Warrior, Mercenary, Sorceress and Monk)
Ascendancies also return, which are basically subclasses for each class, and right now each class has 2 available, with more coming later. The available ascendancies are:
Sorceress - Stormweaver and Chronomancer 
Warrior – Titan and Warbringer 
Ranger - Deadeye and Pathfinder 
Witch - Blood Mage and Infernalist 
Mercenary - Witchhunter and Gemling Legionnaire 
Monk - Invoker and Acolyte of Chayula


[b]Skill System[/b]
Completely overhauled. In PoE1 you had to socket skill gems (which give you abilities) into gear, that is no longer the case, they are now placed into a dedicated skill gem interface, allowing for easier gear upgrades without losing skill setups (and an easier overview is more beginner friendly). Support gems (gems that buff or affect ability gems) are linked directly to individual skill gems, with up to five supports possible, equivalent to a six-link system in the original game


[b]Graphics and Performance[/b]
Significant visual upgrades with a revamped engine, and enhanced character models, animations, and environments. Not gonna lie, game looks crisp af and everything looks amazing


[b]Endgame Content[/b]
If you think that there won’t be much to do in the endgame because this game is only in early access, you’re very much mistaken. It has more content right now than some other games have after full release and with an expansion, it’s incredible. The end game features the so-called Atlas of Worlds system, which is basically a whole lot of end game zones you need to clear and you can access them when you get map items (each map opens several portals to one of the zones). In PoE1 it was a limited amount of maps you could do, but they really outdid themselves and here in PoE2 it’s unlimited. Yes, you heard that right, unlimited!


[b]Difficulty[/b]
The first game also had difficult encounters in it, but in PoE2 it gets very similar to games such as dark souls, especially the bosses. The combat is slower, but more methodical, and you get a dodge roll. Don’t be afraid if that sounds too daunting if you don’t like difficulty, because there might be challenging stuff in this, but it’s overall extremely fair and rewarding.


All in all, I absolutely recommend you to at try it. Just keep in mind that right now this is the beginning of early access, so as impressive as the immense amount of available content is, some issues are expected in these early stages, but just like the first game, this one is absolutely worth your time.

It is so nice to have a Gritty and dark game in this genre again to. It is also very challenging and rewarding at the same time. Die to a boss, learn his attacks, go level up once more and get another item or 2 and come back and get revenge, its so dang fun.

The combat is great, the atmosphere is top notch, its challenging, its rewarding, the controls are great, the locations are awesome, the graphics are gorgeous, it runs well. This game is a modern Diablo 2 and probably will surpass it when its done.

Top notch stuff all around to all involved. I respect the hell out of POE 1 but I didn't get super addicted to it, but after 5.5 hours of POE 2 I am already totally hooked. It does so many things well and once again it is so nice to have a really dark and gritty game in this genre again, Diablo 2 did that best and Grim Dawn did it decently, but this game just comes in swining and gives us a modern Diablo 2 mixed with the challenge and rewarding elements from Elden Ring/Dark Souls and all the stuff we love about POE1/Grim Dawn, Diablo 2,etc..

Already so good, I can't wait to see what it is like when it leaves Early Access. Pick this one up ASAP! Just played 5.5 hours straight and I am loving it, can't say enough about how good this is.

The game is mostly all positive, so many elements are top notch, the only negative for me is I have had a few crashes to desktop so far. Fix that and I will be playing this for 1000 hours + I bet.

If you ever wanted a modern Diablo 2 game, but mixed with Elden RIng's boss fights and rewarding feeling of coming back to a boss after losing and after you have got a few new items and leveled up once and also learned the bosses attacks. To then beat the boss down, and get that rewarding feeling, then this game is for you! This is Diablo 2 mixed with Elden Ring 100%.

Best game in this genre since Diablo 2, might end up being the best ever of this genre when the game is finished to. Huge and vast improvement over PoE1 in nearly every aspect.",1733564484,1733713943,True,3,0,0.5545977354049682,0,True,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,positive,100

What really impressed me was how well the game blends different styles of gameplay. It’s not just your typical ARPG; the combat feels deliberate and engaging. And let me tell you, the boss fights are on another level. One of the campaign bosses was so epic, I just sat there for a moment after the fight, soaking it all in.

Ultimately, you should play a game you enjoy. Expect the game to be nothing like POE 1 and enjoy it slowly instead of rushing through content. You might even find yourself enjoying the game.

Mind you, I'm only giving my opinion based on my experience so far. 

Things to like:
-Hard - Difficult bosses in terms of difficulty. 
Yep, bosses are hard. Git gud learning their gimmicks. Similar to POE1, if you are not prepared to fight bosses, you will struggle more than others. You also start over if you die.

-Diverse skill builds - to an extent. 
Creative freedom. All skills will have different passives you can unlock. New Skill = New Passives (usually) = New buffs for your skills. The limit here is that you have to unlock new skills to get more passives and you might not meet requirements for other skills due to stats or level. (This might be a con for people)

-The Passive Tree.
Learn it, understand it, build around it, get better. (Similar concept from POE1.) You also do not need a wiki to understand Keywords like ""Ailment"". ""Exposure"", ""Elemental Damage"",  etc. (If i could give it a rating, I'd give it a +100) There are also new keywords like ""Magnitude"" and ""Pin"". In my opinion, this is the best part of POE1 and what gives it so much creative freedom. 

-Currency has shifted to Gold.
Gold is the number 1 currency used for transactions with NPCs. Fortunately, you tend to pick up A LOT just for killing mobs. 

-The Orb Systems have been simplified.
You no longer need to learn 50 different currency orbs. It's been simplified to 21. Majority of them, you will never see early game. 

-Refunding Passive Skills cost Gold.
Refunding passive skills require gold and not orb of regrets. Enough said. You can also use the same NPC to identify your items.

-The offensive tab to the skill menu. 
You finally get to see the DPS breakdown of your skills without using Path of Building or similar tools. 


Things to not like:
-Mobs on the map reset when you die. (This might be a pro for some people). 

-Dodging has no i-frames.
Enough said, fund to use otherwise.

-Dodging does not go through mobs.
My biggest gripe. Having no i-frames is one thing, but why can't I roll through mobs...?

-Lack of movement skills. 
Blinks and Dashes have been removed from the skill pool (not sure if they even exist). What movement abilities your character DOES have, should be taken with a grain of salt as they can be slow to cast or go nowhere when cast, or both.

-Getting surrounded almost always means death.
Getting hit by 50 things at once that will not allow you to escape = death. Also, do not back up into a wall for this reason.

-Checkpoints are sometimes placed in questionable areas.
Some checkpoints will be in the middle of a crowd of mobs. It might also be on the opposite side of the map you died in (good luck getting back!)


Things that are meh:
-Character Menu
It removed the offensive tab. So, it's ""simplified"" into one page. 

-Idling
Maps areas will reset if you haven't visited them for a period, similar to POE1. 

-Lost Progress
If you managed to reconnect after disconnecting or the server crashes, you MIGHT still have the same map progression.

-Gamble for gear
It cost more gold to gamble than just buying gear from the NPC that would be better for you anyway. 

-Item drop diversity
1) Rare gear is VERY rare, let alone Uniques. You will be wearing either Magic Gear or white gear for majority of your early playthrough. 
2) I can never find gear that I need for my character. (Your mileage may vary which is why this is meh. Remember, you can always upgrade your white gear)

-Limited Flasks
You can only have 1 health flask and 1 mana flask. This is a weird change in my opinion. Why can't I have two health flasks or two mana flasks like in POE1? What if I don't want to play pathfinder..?

-Charms
Charms are meh at best so far. They add resistance but have to meet a criteria based on what kind of charm they are

-Belts
Belts not having stats are meh. Belts also determine how many charms you can have at once. 

-Weapon Switching
Feels very niche early game because why would you ever need to use 2 weapons at any given point? Also, the ""Weapon Skill Points"" are determined by how many passive points you have which you don't get a lot when you start. (This is probably a mid-end game concept)

Overall, I do enjoy this game because it is NOT like Path of Exile 1. Difficulty scaling on bosses are fine, but the mobs resetting on the maps is also a big con. If i could dodge/move through the mobs, this would not be a problem.

[h2](and does it matter? Let's see.)[/h2]

After three days of diving into this early access experience, I feel ready to share my thoughts. Overall, I've been enjoying the game—its pacing, combat, and new mechanics bring a lot of potential to the table. To organize my feedback, I’ve broken it down into key areas:

[h3]Combat[/h3]
The combat has been a standout aspect so far. It feels weighty and meaningful, steering away from the mindless “click-and-explode” style. Instead, every skill feels purposeful, and combat situations demand a thoughtful approach. I’ve tried three archetypes so far - Warrior with two-handed slams, Deadeye with a crossbow, and Monk with cold staff skills - and each required distinct strategies for the same challenges. This variety is refreshing and adds to the game’s replayability.

Of course, balance is still a work in progress, as expected in early access. For example, I’ve heard casters are feeling underwhelming, particularly in the early game. While I haven’t played them yet, they seem to need some tuning to feel more rewarding.

One unique aspect I appreciate is the lack of a traditional blink or instant movement skill to escape tight situations. While this adds tension and forces careful positioning, the current implementation feels rough. The dragging mechanics, in particular, sometimes feel more like rubberbanding glitches than intentional design. Polishing these elements could significantly enhance the experience.

[h3]Pacing[/h3]
The game’s pacing is slower compared to similar titles, but I find this deliberate approach enjoyable. While some maps are enormous—occasionally feeling a bit too empty - this slower exploration fosters a sense of surprise and discovery, reminiscent of other games I like. That said, trimming down the emptiness in some areas could make the pacing feel even better without sacrificing exploration.

[h3]Difficulty[/h3]
As with combat, difficulty tuning is a mixed bag right now. Early-game mapping can be tougher than boss fights. Monsters have substantial health, surround you quickly, and their movement speed can make escape tricky - especially without reliable means of dodging through mobs. While this can be frustrating at times, I believe it’s a numbers issue. Tweaking enemy health and behavior could create a more balanced challenge without making encounters overwhelming. Personally, I haven’t found it to be a deal-breaker yet (currently at the end of Act 3).

[h3]TL;DR[/h3]
This game has been a refreshing experience that challenges players to adapt to a new rhythm and gameplay style. If you approach it expecting the feel of PoE 1 (or similar games), you might initially struggle to appreciate its unique qualities. But with an open mind, there’s a lot to love here. Sure, it’s not perfect - it’s early access, after all - but the foundation is solid, and I’m excited to see where it goes with more refinement.",1733752749,1733752749,True,13,0,0.5495951771736145,0,True,False,True,False,2694490,20250114_132039,positive,100

-Dont.-

Unless you know what you're getting into. In that case,

Hells Effing Do.

Someone saw Lost Ark, a Souls game, Diablo 2, and said, 'We got PoE bones. Let's make some babies.'

This is PoE2. Hard af, white mobs that will wreck your face as an appetizer for the boss fight that will turn your butt cheeks around and give you the main course.

It has the depth of PoE1 repackaged and steamlined for the new player making it easier to get into than the original in terms of understanding the mechanics but retaining much of the depth. It's a much harder start for the new player in difficulty but that forces the player to really learn the systems or get gated.

If you're a glutton for punishment and are willing to learn and 'gitgud'. This is an absolute fantastic game. If you're just curious, wait. It's currently in Early Access and needs -A LOT- of balancing and tuning (which they're quickly doing). Just wait for the 1.0 launch and enjoy it when it's more polished, it'll be worth the wait. For everyone else, this is not Diablo, Titan Quest, Torchlight, or your average ARPG, it will punch you in the face and won't ask if you want more before pummeling it repeatedly.

[h2]RAMBLES[/h2]

Before we start, note that they are rapidly fixing issues and rebalancing things. It's currently effectively beta. But I -will- rant on the current issues.

[h3]Let's talk difficulty.[/h3]

It's effing hard to start. In PoE1, a filthy casual like me can run through a couple of acts before having to learn anything about why I'm exploding all of a sudden because I've thoroughly neglected all forms of defense and royally hodge-podged my skill tree. Then because I can't respec, I reroll. In PoE2, you can respec with just gold. It's a bit expensive to completely redo a character, but it's not super restrictive leading to plenty of experimentation without worry. And if you screw up, you can farm up in a reasonable amount of time and fix a character in most cases instead of rerolling being the best option.

In PoE2, things get hard, fast. You go into the 'Den of Evil' hole of temptation very early and can get your face smashed in by the first wiggly bit. Then ya learn to use that effing dodge button and feel good about yourself until you walk into the next area and get rammed by charging doggos because dodging does not give you invuln frames for normal attacks. The process of learning is fast, brutal, and quite satisfying. Until you're 30hrs in just trying to get to the next act and the checkpoints are complete butts (they're aware and working on it) and you restart an area for the 200th time dying to a stupid rare boar with temporal bubbles and lightning fast headbutts that stunlock you into a rock.

Boss fights are amazing. It's close to Lost Ark, though not quite as good or as polished, it's very satisfying. There's a constant issue with visibility and it's exacerbated by the boss fights with multiple phase and frickin spell effects all over the screen. This leads to a playstyle of outdps'ing mechanics more than doing them properly. But the mechanics themselves are often fun and the fight arenas are claustrophobic enough for the boss to feel threatening most the time. And my god, the fight start animations, beautiful, the first 10 times. It's sped up after the first, but some could really use a little bit more of that fast forwarding.

Maps are difficult and there needs to be some balancing on drop rate because losing maps is frustration in a can. They're large, they're long, and one wrong move can put all that progress in the trash.

Enemy attack rates needs adjustments. Having a single hag spam slow whirlies and balls of doom all over the place multiplied by spawning 5 frickin hags in a single spot leads to much frustration. Telegraphs need to be clearer with so much visual noise and PoE2's emphasis on 'don't stand on thing you can't see'.

[h3]PoE1 vs PoE2[/h3]

This is not PoE1. It has the bones and materials of 1, but it is it's own game. Personally, I'm happy it's this different as those wanting to enjoy a more traditional Diablo 2-like experience can still enjoy PoE1. This is a different game for different tastes. PoE2 is a slow deliberate building towards the power fantasy. Where PoE1 starts you out strong and ends in you being a Deity-slaying Demi-God, PoE2 is like Kingdom Come Deliverence. You are a Henry. You suck. Gitgud. And by the end, you are gud, you are damn gud. It's a reward-payoff that requires time, patience, and work put in either through skills, knowledge, sheer will, or all of the forementioned to reap the reward at the end. PoE2 in its current state does not hand out free participation trophies.

This can throw a lot of players of ARPGs off, even those coming from PoE1. The difficulty curve doesn't allow for the taste of power before getting reality checked as a lot of ARPGs start with. It throughs the player right into the gauntlet like a Souls game. And that's not for everyone.

[h3]Mechanics[/h3]

This is PoE through and through. You got skills, you got modifiers, you got your three pronged defense in red blue and can't touch this, giant-ass skill tree of 'use search to find big node then figure out how to get there', map crap, boss phasing, and effing ascendency trials (worst effing part of leveling).

It's pretty damn deep, but way more digestible in PoE2 as GGG can reflect on all the PoE1 league mechanics and explain them rather than putting down the railroad track in front of the train then explaining it after the fact. There's a lot of content to explore even in it's current pre-release state.

The controller support is huge. It's not the best, but very enjoyable. Certain times it's hard to target the right interaction (Act3 NPC standing next to a bossfight trigger, items pickup priority, the effing bell for Quarterstaff being a magnet) or to target the right monster but in general, it's a good enough compromise to ease my hands of ARPG clicky-hands.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

I've had a blast dying repeatedly and screaming 'bullshit' while deep inside knowing I just need more gitgudness. There were times when the game wigs out but that's what EA and Betas are for, polish. For anyone just curious, really just wait for 1.0. What's in PoE2 is great, but it needs some time to cook.

But the game is still early access so only 3acts, so we are missing tons of stuff like 6 classes and their ""ascendancy"" a.k.a masteries and 1 of each from current classes.
So there is ""coming soon"" stuff in UI but there is still tons of stuff to enjoy.
Either buy now and get 30€ worth of ingame shop currency and enjoy the game or just wait like 6months when game gets 1.0 release and becomes free to play.

Genre-warpingly revolutionary, really. But it is definitely Early Access and needs tweaks. DO NOT play the game with the expectation that it is finished. I've seen countless people complaining about the game's balance or difficulty without giving any heed to the fact that this is a GAME IN DEVELOPMENT and needs time before it hits the right balance regarding many systems. If you buy an EARLY ACCESS title expecting no problems, you literally deserve to lose your money.

The common complaints that hold water, in my opinion:

Too few support gems are available.
Item drop rate is restrictively low.
Gold drop rate is restrictively low.
Currency/Crafting Orbs drop rate is restrictively low.

These are all real problems, but I don't think I'd recommend the game any less for it. It's early on. Give the game some time. Get in and play it now if you don't mind these problems. I certainly am having a blast regardless.

Overall, the combat is incredibly satisfying and punchy. It feels like a hybrid of Diablo 2 and Dark Souls in a profoundly good way. The way skills combine and play off each other is genius to encourage the use of a full toolkit. The days of mindlessly spamming a single button seem to be dead, thank the lord. 

The art and visuals are breathtaking, and it's running shockingly well on my mid-high end system running a 3080. It really looks like what Diablo should look like. More faithful to the concept than Blizzard has been since Lord of Destruction. The sound design is also staggeringly good. Tremendous impacts, visceral noises, amazing music. Very good voice acting, and the story is clearer and more well fleshed out than PoE 1. It clearly wants to stand toe-to-toe with Diablo 4, and I think it wins in every respect, even though it isn't even finished yet.

The steps taken to improve the intuitiveness of building your own character without build guides being required has been very successful, and made the game extremely fun and welcoming to people like me who do not want to use a build guide to get anywhere. PoE 1 failed to successfully onboard a large number of people because it was impenetrable without guides, and that was what kept me from ever sticking with it past act 6 or 7.

PoE 2 is all but guaranteed to move the genre forward singlehandedly. You can feel the love and effort in almost every part of the game.

The nebulous term ""Gameplay"" is going to be the focus of this review, because my opinion is firmly stuck on that being the most important part of a game, arbitrarily or otherwise. Skip the review if you don't care.

Most D20 systems by their very design are incredibly random, and this is fine in a tabletop environment with friends where you're all going on this journey together, and the hand dealt isn't always optimal but you have fun learning about things in the process - Plus it has a DM that can fudge the rolls from time to time from behind the screen so that players doing impressive and cool things can be rewarded by just pretending that they nat 20'd or something. This, for me, does not work in a preset, unchanging environment like the one found in this game.

This isn't a problem with RNG as a whole, just the breadth of it within BG3's design, which I'd assume is a problem that arose from trying to graft the D&D ruleset exactly how it is onto a videogame, without making enough concessions for the adaptation process. Different games handle this in different ways: Disco Elysium uses a 2d6 system, so that your roll bonuses are more impactful even early on due to the smaller window of possible results, whilst also including a bunch of situational bonuses depending on prior decisions. Fallout NV removes RNG entirely by just allowing you to talk about the things that your skills say you have the know-how to talk about. D&D's ""Everyone can succeed and everyone can fail"" mentality is suitable for the tabletop,  but since the other characters won't really have many interactions with your bad rolls, the story can't change too drastically because of them, and the DM can't make silly things happen in response, the one true difference between this and the tabletop begins to shine through: Reloading.

Outside of Ironman modes, all of these games allow you to just fail a check and then reload to roll it again, which begs the question why any of these games even bother to have dice rolls at all, except to waste your time reloading when the coin flip fails, or more likely, to better simulate the tabletop game experience for its own sake.

Your choices only matter when you want them to matter, so you might as well install a mod that bypasses every single roll in dialogue and you'd have the exact same experience, just much quicker. There is nothing enjoyable in the failures in dialogue, there's no Harry to leap through the air flipping the double bird only to crash into a disabled NPC, there's no silliness added in - It's all very classy, it's all played surprisingly safe despite how horny it is. Granted, this isn't what fully kills the game for me, I'm not averse to CYOA books after all.

The issues of gameplay are much more prevalent in the combat, which suffers the same weird RNG problems as the dialogue (with the same savescumming possibilities) and somehow fewer options. D&D's combat system (especially 5E's) is so simple that anyone can pick it up, and play it at a table with nothing but some dice and some scraps of paper. This is great for the tabletop where nothing is automated, and it works fine in the game - It's just so unbearably dull for me.

There are so many different variables in play, about the shape of the map and where you can stand, good vantage points for ranged attacks or chokepoints to prevent approaches, there's different status ailments and a dizzying array of damage types, weird surface conditions and even the light level - But in the three attempts I had of this game, all on different difficulties, none of that really mattered. Sure it'd be cool in the tabletop to stealthily shoot out a lit candle so your opponents can't see you as well, and have a nice narrative moment where your allies can quip (even if you bollocks it up), in BG3 there's no real need to do anything other than march full speed into your enemies' faces and spam whatever abilities you like best until the rolls have determined that you've won, and then immediately long rest.

The game's difficulty and complexity are rendered moot by the wealth of perfectly viable options, the presence of more viable options at all is rendered moot by the wildness of a D20, and any differences between the viability of those options is rendered moot by the ability to reload a save and succeed no matter what. Tactician mode's combat difficulty had two speeds: Standard, and nearly impossible without savescumming, brought on entirely by when in your progress you choose to approach an encounter. It added in JRPG grinding-for-beefgates into this D&D game, without any direct indication (For the record, I'm cool with JRPG grinding, it's just strange to see it here in a game that isn't conducive to it). Tactician doesn't make the game more ""Tactical"", as the most effective strategy I can think of off the top of my head is to have 4 Warlocks using max range Eldritch Blast on everyone, and just praying that the hit and damage dice both roll high. If they don't roll high, reload; You weren't going to win anyway. The game never requires you to interact with all this stuff that effort went into making, is what I'm getting at here. 

Combat feels like a (weirdly easy) slog, and despite all of the different abilities and classes, none of them really feel all that different to one another. The key differences seem to be what your effective range is, whether or not you can heal, and how many times you can attack in a single turn, or between rests, everything else ends up just being variations of the same gameplay loop for every character. Maybe at Level 20 there's some secret sauce I'm missing, but the game can just not hold my attention long enough with its Fisher-Price mechanics to have me journey beyond Act 2.

It's hard to describe exactly why it's like this.
Maybe it's the hard action limit per turn?
So many buffs and alterations are full actions when they feel like they should be bonus actions. It might be the AP system alone that prevents me from having the same gripes with Divinity 2. 

Maybe it's the lack of impact or indication that all of these different damage types are actually doing something, outside of ""Well that enemy looks like it's a bit on fire, so I won't use fire on it."" - Divinity 2's exploding poison puddles were always good for a laugh.

The real problem is likely not with the game, but with me, and people like me who have bothered to read all this way into the review who just want games to be more engaging than they are perhaps meant to be.

I almost want to say ""I don't know who this game is for"" which is bizarre and hilarious since it's such a popular and well-received game; It appears to be for everybody. Its narrative has gore, violence, dark themes, sex, even genitalia on the character creation screen, but then once the nitty-gritty of the gameplay rears its ugly head, it turns into Snakes & Ladders. It's like the opposite of a mascot platformer.

If you enjoy it, more power to you, I kind of envy that. I genuinely wish I could just overlook the game's boring combat to enjoy the parts about it that are actually pretty decent - My last attempt was even on the easiest difficulty so that I could just blitz through it as fast as possible, but it was still too much of a bugbear to get over.

tl;dr
Gameplay over all. You can still have the other things too, just do good gameplay first pls. If you agree with that, skip this game.

This review implies I know what good gameplay is, obviously. Lol.

The one positive thing I can share that isn't immediately obviously present in the blue reviews is that, I'm glad that what is essentially ERPing with someone's OCs is not only more widely accepted now, but one of this game's key selling points.

TLDR2: [b]If you enjoy the cRPG genre, this game is almost certainly for you;[/b] (and I'm surprised you haven't bought it yet in light of its near universal acclaim, why are you reading this?)

I bought this game on the back of the universally positive reception. I can see why it has its stellar reputation. [b]I believe it deserves its reputation[/b], with a caveat: If you haven't been able to get into cRPGs in the past due to the various dice-based systems, but saw the reviews and thought that this product might transcend your expectations, I think you will be disappointed, primarily due to the prevalence of a large number of dice rolls that can instantly kill you or wipe your party.

I started off having a great time, the world is carefully crafted, the characters I've met are interesting and well written. There are so many options given to the player when wandering the world, from using abilities to talk to animals or corpses to gain special advantages or insight, to (expected for this genre) skullduggery of sneaking, pickpocketing, and lockpicking your way to success.

Unfortunately, as I started to get further into Act 1, I started getting killed by the dice; repeatedly. I found an enemy lying on the ground wounded and, though the game did warn me approaching was dangerous, I was curious about what I might be able to learn from them. The game threw a dice roll at me that I failed, and my character was immediately killed, forcing a reload. I hadn't saved in awhile, so I lost some progress. No big deal, I've learned my lesson, I thought to myself, I'll just save more frequently so that I don't lose so much progress like that again. So I approached the situation differently the next time and avoided death.

Hours of gameplay passed in Act 1. I was still having a decent time, and I was especially having fun talking to people, using my persuasion and clever wits to gain advantages and access new content. I scraped past some difficult fights with enemies that I thought were fairly challenging, and I've have to reload after mismanaging a fight or failing to take something into account.

Then the fights got harder, and harder, and harder. Enemies vastly outnumber you, each enemy gets their own dice to roll against you. More dice against you means they're going to roll more critical successes, which they did, frequently. I encountered a fight near a cave in act 1. The first time I entered the area, my party was wiped on the first round. The second time I was wiped on the first round. It kept happening. Critical success rolls given to enemies with multiple attacks would kill my characters in a single turn. I tried to prioritize the heavy hitters, but could not do enough damage before they'd wipe my party in short order. I gave up and tried to approach the fight from a different angle. I was able to initiate dialog and get one of the tough enemies on my side through my social and magical abilities, and barely squeaked out a victory!

All the enemies dead: [b]Dialog was immediately initiated by the character I had earlier convinced to fight for me with the closest of my party members.[/b] This party member was not my ""designated talker"", failed his dice rolls, and was attacked. Several of my other characters, wounded or dying, were unable to assist. My party was wiped. Game over. The fight had lasted nearly an hour. I'd need to reload a save again. I realized I was not enjoying being killed by the dice. I felt no desire to repeat the endeavor. I closed the game, and I now leave this review.

I might revisit the game again sometime, but I suspect that this type of game is just not for me. I don't have the experience with dice-based combat that could help me succeed in situations like this, and I find the experience so punishing that I do not have any desire to ""get good"" constantly reloading saves to try and figure out what I am supposed to do to progress. I desperately want to experience more of this game's writing, narrative, and interesting choices, but they feel inaccessible to me; gated behind tactical dice-based combat that is punishing and cruel.

My understanding is that in actual D&D sessions, a good GM is responsible for ensuring the players enjoy themselves, in spite of the challenges they are presented. I did not feel like there was a good GM behind the scenes. I felt a cold calculating computer, looming over me with murderous intent, forcing me to reload saves. 14 hours and FIFTY quicksaves later, I am putting this game down, disappointed; and can't offer a recommendation to any of my friends who aren't already in love with cRPGs.",1711827433,1711827707,False,64,10,0.6332225799560546,6,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,negative,100

Genuinely, I love this game, and I didn't believe the others that said Act 3 is a [i]large problem.[/i] It is. I get it now. I also want to fight whoever is personally responsible for rushing this game.
It is [i]so so good[/i] but unfortunately, there are glitches that are genuinely game breaking, as in you physically cannot play the game when it happens. That and instructions and quest lines in Act 3 are... unclear at best and non-existent at worst.

Once the issues that [i]stop you from playing the game entirely[/i] are fixed, I'd be happy to change my review. Unfortunately, there are some that are even showing up as early as Act 2. Here's a little list of things I have run into that, granted, [i]I do see them trying to patch,[/i] but are unfortunately still issues as of this review:

[b]*Getting stuck in dialogues.[/b] Either you enter the dialogue and no options pop up, or you are counted as in dialogue and nothing else happens. You are simply stranded, immovable and inactive, until a team mate can either pull you far enough away to end the convo, or worse yet has to kill you to avoid having to load a save that was a whole half hour ago.
[b]*Getting stuck at 100% loads.[/b] I am unsure why this happens, but sometimes loading a save will cause the game to load to completion, and then never actually put you in the game. This one is extra annoying because the entire party will have to Alt-F4 the game or use Task Manager to kill it, because even if the host kills it, the other players are still stuck.
[b]*Bugging out when trying to assign characters to the correct players.[/b] I am unsure why this happens, but sometimes when swapping characters between people, they will both lose the ability to use either character entirely, as well as any summons attached to them. Usually the host will have to reboot the save, and pray the above issue doesn't happen.

There are also some things that don't stop you from playing the game, but can badly hinder the experience:

[b]*Fights and encounters during long rests.[/b] If the host starts a long rest before all players have successfully joined, they cannot enter the game until the long rest is completed. This also forces them to miss any encounters that happen during that time. You wouldn't think this would be so bad, as most of the encounters during rests are minor and unimportant... [i]But![/b] There are a few very *very* important ones, namely with your dream visitor. Spoilers ahead on that: [spoiler]We had this happen on the encounter with The Emperor when he reveals his true identity. The entire fight, the reveal, and the option to become half Illithid were all missed by myself, and I happen to be the one romancing him, and gunning to become an Illithid.[/spoiler] Personally, I think if there is any combat going on during a long rest that players should be able to join there... not just for what I just mentioned, but also because the host likely does not want to deal with the entire encounter with their team mates' characters that they do not know how to play.
[b]*Turning invisible for no particular reason.[/b] This one is not too bad, but it is highly annoying and admittedly really ruins the immersion and playing experience.
[b]*Animation rig glitching during cutscenes.[/b] This one could get a pass, but it is a liiiiittle distracting to try and have a serious in game conversation, romances for example, where the head rig completely breaks at the neck for a few seconds. Again, immersion.
[b]*Lack of clarity on what you are supposed to do.[/b] I am looking particularly at Act 3 for this one. I'm not expecting it to hold your hand, but some clarity would be nice. The quests in that act like to tell you some vague thing you need to go get done, and then not give you a place to start. Worse yet, sometimes it will point it out for you on the map in completely the wrong location, if it gives you a location at all. I never had to use that function until act 3, and a good couple quests give you a location that is nowhere near where the actual place you need to go is at. Other times they give you the name of a location and then refuse to give you any guidance as to where the heck that is. In particular, [spoiler]the Murder Mystery quest to locate Orin[/spoiler] really likes to tell you to go do things and give you no good direction to start looking, and infuriatingly, is non optional [spoiler]if you want to kill her first[/spoiler]. If you want to go the other route, [spoiler] the quest marker for Gortash actually points you to the passage downstairs instead of upstairs, where he actually is.[/spoiler] All of this is fine and dandy, if you are playing the whole thing in one go. If you are playing it in short spurts, you will likely forget a lot of things, and wind up on a goose chase. It really doesn't come off fun or clever to me at all, just infuriatingly annoying.

Fundamentally, the moment-to-moment dialogue writing is just mediocre. There are memorable and charming characters, but, once you reach past the surface level, nearly every character has the most predictable, bog-standard reaction to every single situation they come across. Very rarely did any of the writing wow me with wit, expression, or character. It doesn't matter what happens, from simple banter to life-changing moments to deaths of loved ones, everything feels like a bland first draft you’d jot down before actually thinking of an interesting or moving way of writing a scene. Dialogue options are very obvious with what interactions they are trying to pull you into, sometimes even presupposing actions that make no sense for anyone involved (knowledge they could not possibly have, or referencing things I never did).
This lack of quality sadly extends to the story as a whole. I simply think Larian bit off more than they could chew, as the sheer scope of what they pulled off is unbelievably impressive, but still just not enough for what they were trying to do. Rather than even “just” a 100 hour game with tighter writing and more fleshed out characters, the game is ballooned to such a scale that few things feel fully finished and it leaves the entire experience feeling messy and hollow to me. There are a handful of key character progression points, but beyond those, I rarely had any meaningful connection to my party members. At the end of Act 1, the game suddenly shovels all their character moments on you in quick succession before pulling back again for most of Act 2. Fair enough, we’re in the thick of a dramatic plot, but the generic cultist villains just aren’t nearly as interesting.
I fully intended to finish the game despite my gripes, but the moment that finally broke me was this one (kept vague for spoiler reasons):
I was going through a dungeon that was important to one of my party members. They were raving about an ideology that I did not agree with, but every time the game gave me the ability to talk to them about it, the options boiled down to “Your ideology is fucking dumb” and “Yeah, you’re good C:”
I kept hoping to reach a point where the game would let me genuinely interact with their ideology and their character, but it never happened. I’ve heard there was some flag I could have set beforehand that would have made this character more amiable in this section, but that doesn’t fix my issue. In fact, it makes it worse, confining meaningful character interactions to whether you’ve completed a set scripted quest item is the opposite of immersive (except, it likely wouldn’t have been meaningful. i have reason to believe it would have been just as boring, but the character would have been easier to convince). By the end of the dungeon we reached a major decision point for this character, one that would further cement their ideology or let them break free from it. And once more, I was faced with essentially two options. “Don’t do it, I believe in you :,C” or “Yeah, you’re good C:” I then failed a persuasion check, the character turned hostile, and I was forced to kill them. This is all extremely disappointingly bland, but I could have lived with it.
However. The entire section had no further dialogue at all. Not from any of the other party members, not during the combat sequence, nothing. When I returned to camp afterwards, not a single one of the others had anything to say about the fact that we were just forced to tragically kill one of our friends and compatriots. Not a word of acknowledgment. I realized in that moment that Larian probably didn’t intend for anyone to actually go through with this story beat. Whether they lacked the time or the resources or whatever, I assume they figured players would just reload. Well I hadn’t reloaded once to change story outcomes in the 100 or so hours I had put in because I trusted the game to respect the choices I made. And what’s the point of having die-roll fail cases if I’m not actually meant to go through with them? I’d seen other character deaths go unacknowledged before (like an entire village’s worth of named characters being eradicated. nobody gave a shit. again, probably just figured the players would reload), but not a party member’s. That was one step too far and right then what was left of the immersion I had in this story completely shattered.
If you want a videogamey romp through a DnD world, you’ll have a good time. And that is a statement fully without judgment. I had a lot of fun with the combat and exploring the various locations is exciting and rewarding as a massive semi-open-world encounter-filled funhouse.
But if you want to be genuinely immersed in the story and characters and feel like your actions are meaningfully impactful, be prepared to potentially be game-ruiningly disappointed depending on what choices you make and how willing you are to look past the gaping holes left in the decision tree.

Minor grrr to end off:
The UI is straight up baffling. Randomly, things just won't stack, like you'll have 6 of an item and then just another stack of 2 more identical ones. Sometimes you can then manually stack them, sometimes the game just refuses. You can only send things to camp sometimes. Sometimes you can't mark and send multiple things to other characters or camp. Micromanaging your characters' inventories is a nightmare, especially in combat. Sometimes you can split a stack of potions to send to another party member, sometimes you just can't. I think this all has something to do with whether you’re sending from your main character, I honestly don't remember because it makes so little sense I probably compartmentalized the trauma.

First: I am not a big fan of 5e as a CRPG. Its too simple for a deep crunch. It always leaves me wanting more crunch to bite into or leaves me wanting it to go a ton faster. I think some of Larians changes to the game help it, but it still leaves me just wanting more and not in a good way. I dont get excited about leveling up because of the lack of choices many classes have. 

Second: The companions. I think when I got to act 3 I basically enjoyed... 2 of them? When I first played this in EA, everyone was saying ""oh this is only half of the companions we will get, this is all the evil ones, they will have a bunch of other ones added in the end, etc."" and in the end that was kinda a lie. Basically outside of the main 5(?) the rest that are there feel even more flat and not fleshed out than the main 5. And I can barely stand the main 5. One of the biggest things I enjoyed about DOS2 and other CRPGS is the companions, they add life to the game... These companions suck away the life from the game for me. 

Three: Act 3. Yea this felt like a huge letdown. When I first got to around the time the game came out it was unplayable on my comp. Now its better, but still kinda a huge letdown. It feels so unfinished. Its the same thing with DOS2. the game is so frontloaded and goes out on what feels like a whimper. The big bads of the area feel like they barely thought them out, and I was just left dissapointed.

Four: The vibes, I dunno how to describe this but the game is very nouveau dnd. Its kinda goofy, non serious while still trying to be ""serious"". It has the same vibes I got while playing a bunch of dnd5e games. kinda goofy superhero character driven, while not really caring about the world, story, etc. Its just really hard to describe how I feel, but the vibes are just something I never clicked with.

I feel like there is more, like how some choices end up being non-choices and not mattering [spoiler] illithid powers use [/spoiler] and just other random things that kinda just picked at me.


I dunno overall I really did want to like it, but typically I would go back to a crpg to play a second or third time.

My initial reaction when the game went to 1.0 last year was not a positive one.  Yet, with all the undying praise of this game and my enjoyment of this genre, I believed I had missed something that others had discovered.  I wanted to know what that was.  So over the past year I have started, stopped, uninstalled, reinstalled, and repeated this process numerous times.  I had made over half a dozen characters and new starts and only just in this recent play through finally was able to pull myself through Act 1.

I do not like this game.

It is final.  68 hours is more than enough.

[u][b]Presentation[/b][/u]

Let me get some praise out of the way before I get to the negatives.  Firstly, this game is beautiful.  The production values are top notch.  This is by far and away the most visually appealing cRPG I've ever played.  

In terms of sound outside of voice work, it is mostly passable.

[u][b]Story[/b][/u]

Here it comes, the bad.  

I do not think this is a good story.  

Not only is the story itself not good, the way it is told is downright awful.  It is disjointed and requires you to play through in a specific way to see it told in a coherent fashion.  This is a large failing because this game prides itself on being open-ended (not exactly [i]open[/i] world) and playing through the game organically (you know, actually [i]roleplaying[/i]) can lead to some truly bizarre instances where characters suddenly do or know something that did not happen in your playthrough.  

The biggest failing with the story is not that it is just poorly told, it is poorly conceived.  The main story is a bull rush of urgency.  You and your ""friends"" are not only dying, you're turning into a hive-mind tentacle monster that will torture you in unimaginable agony for days beforehand.  This is what we call, an [u]emergency[/u].  [i]Everything[/i] else should be not just secondary, but completely out of mind.  Does that matter?  No.  Quite the opposite, the game actively pushes you to do side content in order to progress in this silliness.

I'm old enough to remember people lambasting Fallout 4 for a similar main quest that completely eclipsed the rest of the side content.  Why was that awful and stupid and this is award-winning fiction?

Also, the setting is D&D Epic, but with low level mooks.  Epic settings lead to boring, uninspired, stories.  Mask of the Betrayer for NWN2 is a rare exception.

But hey, at least the characters are fun, right?

[u][b]Characters[/b][/u]

No, they are not.

I do not like these people that call themselves companions.  They are annoying.  They are poorly written, they are out of place, and in some cases, they are hilarious in the conception.

Take Wyll, for instance.  He is a chaotic good warlock that fancies himself the ""Blade of Frontiers"", a do-gooder that is willing to do anything for the greater good.  He has slain demons, minotaurs, devils, and assorted other fiends.  [i]By the dozens.[/i]  You meet him and he is level 2.

Alright Brenil, but the brain worms de-leveled him by 18!

Mhmm...  let me tell you a little something I learned from my experiencing DMing D&D.  Characters that have epic backstories, especially at level 1, are garbagemen.  They're terrible characters, usually Mary/Marty Sues that every one else hates and wishes would meet the gravedirt.

Okay, forget Wyll.  What about the others?  Oh, they're better.  But not much.  Astarion, Lae'zel, Karlach, and to some extent Gale, are all dumb and unlikable.  I'll give Gale a pass as he's supposed to be kind of a good-hearted goofball.  Astarion?  Edgy neutral evil vampire that belongs more in Twilight than D&D?  No.  Told him to go join the boar in the bush.  Lae'zel?  I gave her a try.  She played the lawful evil Githyanki quite well.  Too bad no one likes githyanki for a reason.  I told her to get in the brain machine in the creche and was disappointed with the semi-positive results.  Karlach?  See Wyll.

That leaves Minthara, Halsin, and Shadowheart.  Halsin?  Didn't interact much outside the story.  Shadowheart?  She's the most interesting companion you meet initially in Act 1, but she's a Cleric of Shar.  In Faerun, that usually means kill on sight.  Not exactly something you should [i]emblazon[/i] on your armor.  Unraveling her story is mildly interesting but nothing stellar.  I imagine her main appeal is that she is the most physically attractive character.

Last is not a companion you can recruit in Act 1, but she can become one later.  That is Minthara.  I actually enjoyed this character the most.  After choosing to side with her, you learn more about her and I actually cared to do so for the first time in the game.  Of course, siding with her means you do some dirty deeds, but by this point in my playing this game, I hated everyone anyway.

All that said, on the whole, the characters do not help the story.

But hey, Brenil, my man.  At least the game is fun, right?

[u][i]Gameplay[/i][/u]

No, it isn't.

BG3 uses 5th Edition D&D.  I am not a fan of 5th Edition, but I knew what I was getting into and I loved Solasta.  

The game is unfun to play.  The chief reason for this is two-fold.  

First, the UI.  The UI does nothing helpful for the player.  Finding out why X or Y enemies do Z is difficult and, sometimes, impossible to do in the game.  Like so much of the game, you have to look to an external source to help with a solution the UI should readily provide.  Add to this the awful inventory system that has learned [i]nothing[/i] from previous cRPGs, and you have poor inactive gameplay.

The active gameplay is the second problem.

This game has the worst encounters I have played in any cRPG in my life.  I have played a few of them.

The issue with the encounters in this game is that Larian thinks combat should be ""challenging"".  That's fine, I understand.  But challenging doesn't mean punishing.

Throughout Act 1 after the encounter at the Druid grove, the game decides to get cheeky.  Not just set pieces and boss fights.  [i]Every[/i] encounter.  Combat in this game is a puzzle.  The solution, more often than not, is metagaming, exploiting, save scumming, or all three.

To say this makes the game frustrating is an understatement.  Does it make it hard?  I suppose, but the solution is usually readily apparent - if you are willing to game the system right back.  But wait, isn't this a [i]roleplaying[/i] game?  Isn't meta knowledge an anathema to playing the role of a character?  No, shut up n00b, and sneak a barrel into the enemy camp and watch go boom.

Combat in this game is very similar to another cRPG series.  Divinity:  Original Sin.  I did not like those games either.  They were serious/silly RPGs that had bizarre mechanics and a huge emphasis on big explosions equals big fun.

[u][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/u]

Look, I have been harsh in this review.  I understand this.  I have been accused of being a contrarian.

I gave this game more than a fair chance to wow me.  The game actively frustrated me to the point of anger at times.  If a game is not fun.  Why play it?

I have seen other negative reviews here that follow my thought pattern.  Most will wave their hand and say something along the lines of, ""It's a good game, its just not for me.""  I disagree.  I believe this [i]is[/i] a bad game.  For what is a bad game if not one that gives you nothing but grief?  It can have well-made aspects, but the whole is greater than the parts and Baldur's Gate 3 is not worth your time or money.

Hmm... wait a moment.  I just remembered.  I didn't like The Witcher 3 either.  Crap.  Maybe I am just a contrarian after all.",1729990271,1729990779,False,13,1,0.5547816157341003,2,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,negative,100

the story in this game is for me at least just not fun,

but u are seemingly forced to make story choices by dice roll on the screen over and over and i get that it is something that this game is known for and some like it im not taking it away from u,

i wont go too much into spoilers but towards the end the twists that come up made me lose all the rest of the interest of the story, and essentially like the game basically took a dump on all the previous effort i went thru

*BG3 doesn't feel like a BG game, it's more like a DoS game (which sort of makes sense, right?), which isn't a bad thing, but it says BG on the tin, right?

* Slow AI in battles. I mean, sometimes it's ridiculous how long some of the mobs take to do absolutely nothing on their round.

* Stupid pathfinding AI outside of battles, how many times have your characters jumped off a building to get somewhere, hurting themselves, instead or taking the safe route or just plain getting stuck because they can't make a jump, again instead or taking a slightly longer route?

* Just as you think you are going to kill an enemy they stay at 1HP, and you keep missing like an idiot. Does this happen a lot or am I just imagining things?

* Did anyone else feel that the magical items, like rings and so on, felt a bit meh'ish? Am I too used to the old rulesets with general stat boosts and what not? A lot of the items felt über-specific for a character and was worthless to anyone else.

* Timed missions like The Iron Throne, almost ruined the game for a adventure/casual/exploration player like myself. On goo-goo-ga-ga difficulty, I should be able to turn timers off. I want to explore in peace. Was there any critical timed stuff in BG1 or 2?

* Like above but timed world events. Durgh. Stop stressing me out man. Take one extra rest and people die and missions fail. Urgh.

* The worst camera in any game of this type I've ever played. So many beautiful shots of inside of walls though.

* Romancing is super intrusive. Could have been handled better. Feels super-weird having a whole bunch of people trying to come on to me all the freaking time. Then again, maybe it's a role playing thing. You are a bit of a celebrity in game, so maybe it goes with the territory? Still, eww.

* Shadowheart. Am I right? You could call the game 'Shadowheart - the eternal escort quest'. I've never seen a more useless character ever. She had shield ability yes, but did she ever land a shield blow parry thing ever? No. I can't name another character whose spells missed as often as hers. What's up with that? Maybe it's a thing I should have roleplayed too.

* As usual in most games, when you play on exploration/adventure/casual/goo-goo-ga-ga difficulty like I like to, because I like exploration and quests, the difficulty ramps up way too hard when you find a boss. It goes from ""Hey, this is pretty decent."" to ""What the hell just happened?!""

* Tails and Cloaks. Minor gripe, but still. Tails and cloaks totally slid through QC. Tails just clip.

In summary:

If you played BG1 and BG2 and are expecting BG3 to feel even remotely the same, well, it just doesn't, and it's not only because of the 3d-ness of the game. Don't get me wrong, I like the 3d-ness. It's the problem with all late sequels, I mean this game came out 20 some years after BG2. They shoes are wa-ay too large to fill, the expectations are practically unobtainable. It is not a bad game by any measure, even with my many complaints, it is not. Yet, they opted to call it BG3. They went there knowingly, sucking in people like me who thought they wrould perhaps get a whiff of that beautiful, beautiful nostalgia. Yeah, you got me again. Damn nostalgia. When Will I learn? Anyway, I am infact recommending this game, but only if you can pick it up in the bargain bin. It just doesn't feel complete yet. Maybe a few more patches? Maybe the devs are busy trying to get a DLC out the door who knows?

Now for what is bad:

In order to play this game you need to have the quick save key bound to your breathing because no matter what you do it will backfire into your face. The combat in this game makes you feel like you're walking on eggshells, NOT because of how ""cool"" or ""intimidating"" something might be, but because of just how many things can go so unfavorably for you. A dialogue will end and you'll just get chain attacked and everyone in your party will die and then you realized you didn't quick save and now you have to replay an hour worth of game to get back to where you were. The ONLY way to play this game is by save scumming. You can't go into any encounter without saving before, seeing what kind of gimmick is headed your way, and then loading the save to prepare for that gimmick. It kind of ruins the whole game honestly because you end up just being worried the whole time that something is going to go bad at all times.

Not to mention every character you face is a sponge to your attacks and can dodge everything you throw at it despite having the proper level, yet your character gets absolutely decimated by (almost) every attack. Every encounter is an ambush and every enemy is needlessly hard. 

I shouldn't have to save scum and min max to enjoy your game. If this game were a tabletop like DnD people would stop playing it in 3 seconds.

1.)  The forever loading of a saved game that can only be remedied by a hard reset of the game.
2.)  When assigning multiplayer characters, the player characters become transparent, cannot be controlled, and we cannot access load games or use the menu which can only be remedied by....a hard reset of the game.

There have also been hollowed out dialogue options that were bugged just because and story content was missed or a hard reset had to be done.

We have re-installed the game, verified game files etc--nothing works, and but if you look online, there are tons of other people who have the same issue but their criticisms go unheard because of the overwhelming love of this game.

Unfortunately, after spending a few hours in the game, I find myself more frustrated than impressed.

Visually, the game is undeniably vibrant—perhaps too vibrant. The dark, gritty atmosphere that defined the earlier entries has been replaced with an overly colorful, almost cartoonish palette that feels out of place in the world of Baldur’s Gate. Instead of a deep and immersive fantasy world, it often feels like a whimsical reimagining, closer in style to Divinity: Original Sin than a continuation of the series I loved.

The writing is where the game really falters for me. Too often, the dialogue feels shallow, at times even cringe-inducing, lacking the depth and sophistication that made Baldur’s Gate 1&2 so engrossing. Rather than mature, nuanced storytelling, it sometimes feels like the game is trying too hard to cater to a broader, less demanding audience. It’s hard to connect with characters or take the plot seriously when the tone shifts awkwardly between campy humor and moments that should carry emotional weight but end up falling flat.

Mechanically, Baldur’s Gate 3 stays true to its D&D roots, and while that’s something I appreciate, it’s the overall tone and approach that make the game feel like it’s lost its way. The charm and complexity of the originals have been overshadowed by a focus on flashy visuals and quirky moments that often lack substance.

However, maybe it’s not entirely the game’s fault. Perhaps it’s a reflection of how times have changed. I’ve grown older, and the gaming landscape has evolved. It feels like we live in an era where entertainment leans toward simplicity, and audiences are more content with surface-level experiences. What once felt rich and complex has now given way to what some might call a more “accessible” approach. Sometimes, it feels like we’re living in a version of Idiocracy, where depth is sacrificed for instant gratification, and people celebrate what used to be considered basic.

In the end, Baldur’s Gate 3 may not be for everyone, especially those of us who grew up with the original games. It may resonate more with today’s players, but for me, it just doesn’t capture the magic that made the earlier entries so unforgettable.",1727776683,1727776683,False,21,3,0.5224353075027465,5,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,negative,100

Occasional bits of goodness and generally excellent voice acting, nice textures for equipment and hair but aside this is instantly forgettable fare for early teenagers who likely spend more time modelling and then stripping the rather limited array of PCs than actually playing. If they did play then they'd have more of a constructive view on BG3's limitations.

It's essentially a Divinity game, so if you liked or disliked one of those, that will be much more predictive of whether you like BG3 than your feelings on earlier Baldur's Gates would be.

The production values are mostly good, but a number of points dragged it down for me:
[list]
[*] The game's content is far too densely-packed, and it tries far too hard to push it at you. You can rarely proceed a single screen-width without running into numerous quests, chests, NPCs, and points of interest. This might sound like a positive thing, but it quickly becomes overwhelming; if you try to do any particular thing that catches your interest, you'll be besieged by countless hooks for other stuff. There's no sense of pacing with suitable breathers between events, and the points where you can finally feel [i]finished[/i] with a particular area and ready to move on to the next are on the scale of 10-20 hours apart. The design seems not to trust the player to engage in self-directed exploration of the world; this might be the right choice on average, but it doesn't suit me.
[*] There's no true pause available: you can go into a ""turn-based mode"", but that only affects a small area around your party, and doesn't work for some things. Besides being inconvenient, this further contributes to a feeling of constant pressure and overly-intense pacing.
[*] The 5th Edition D&D rules are designed for tabletop play. They're not fully suited to a computer game like this. For example, tabletop D&D has the fundamental problem of needing to keep people interested during combat when they only get to make occasional decisions between a lot of laborious calculations; BG3 doesn't necessarily have to worry about that, but the combat systems are still heavily adapted to it. (This was something of a problem for earlier Baldur's Gates as well. 2e was jankier and less deliberately designed, and — largely by luck — a number of things kind of cancelled one another out and made it mostly work.)
[*] The party members are too-clearly written according to some kind of framework or rubric. They're superficially varied, but little effort was put into disguising their similarity at even one level of analytical abstraction. Moreover, none of them have rough design edges left over, but neither do any of them have passion or a soul behind them. I've certainly read many worse characters; at the same time, I'd rather read successes and failures alike than the output of a method that produces neither.
[*] The cinematography is the same kind of garbage you see in typical modern films and television. (Based on the popularity of the style, I don't think most players will dislike it, though. I'm just being an annoyingly artsy type.)

When I heard that people spend hours in the character creator, I thought it was going to be the best thing since Oblivion's character creator. I was sorely mistaken. You get to decide a template facial structure and then color it. How would that take hours? If you're looking for a good, in-depth character creator, don't look here.

Secondly, the game was marketed like it was a 5e video game. This game is not like 5e, it has traces of 5e in it, but it's effectively not 5e at all; it's a bastardization of 5e at best. If you're looking for a good mirror of Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition, don't look here.

Thirdly, this game is packed full of unattractive and undesirable romance options. As a straight male, my romance options in Act 1 were:
-A dysgenic, shady half-elf.
-An uppity, frog person.
-A foul-mouthed, rambunctious devil.
-A chronically evil drow.
The game seems to be all about ""player choice"", unless your choice is something vanilla, like a normal human female for your normal human male. The closest ""vanilla"" choice you can get is a very untrustworthy half-elf who's extremely dysgenic. If that's the most vanilla you get, that's really disappointing.
Furthermore, along the lines of my previous point about player choice, this game has such a strong focus on degeneracy, that it lacks in the good morality region. This game allows you to have sex with a bear as well as a certain aberrant creature, which I will not disclose for those willing to stoop to such a disgusting level.
The next point following the last, the majority of origin characters have the same ideals: ""Muh freedom and liberties."" This game puts such a keen focus on hyper-individualism that it teaches a bad lesson to the youth who play the game.
If you're looking for a game that allows real player choice and a game that doesn't try to shove degeneracy down your throat, don't look here.

Continuing on, before I got the game, I was being told by countless others who already had the game, ""Oh, I'm 120 hours in and still in Act 1."" 120 is an example from one of the people I've talked to, but the average was right around there. So I was hyped for a content-filled game—a game I could sink more hours into than all the Skyrim I've ever played on all the consoles and PCs I've ever played it on combined. But that was far from the truth. I played the game at a leisurely pace, exploring all the side quests I could get my hands on and seeking out any secrets I could find, and I finished the game in 45 hours. Looking back at the people who are 120 hours into Act 1, I question their mental processing skills. Do they sit on one dialogue option for days on end? Do they seek to count every blade of grass? So if you're looking for a game that you could sink hours into, comparable to Skyrim, in one play-through, don't look here.
I've played for 113 hours due to all the multiplayer, and I'll get to that.

Lastly, multiplayer. If you're here for the story and to enjoy the plot, multiplayer is not the right option for you. Multiplayer in this game is far more fun when you know the story and the content and just want to mess around with your friends. If you're looking for a game where you can sit down with friends and do the story together, don't look here.

In conclusion, if you peel back: the poor character creator, the 5e bastardization, the degeneracy and lack of player choice (unless you're a degenerate), the mediocre amount of content there is, and the need to do a singleplayer run first before you multiplayer, if you simply ignore all the political agenda of Larian Studios that gets shoved down your throat and don't think of this game as D&D inspired, then yes, I will admit it is a pretty fun game.
It is quite a hefty task to enjoy the game.",1706307326,1733650158,False,11,3,0.5118012428283691,0,False,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,negative,100

I know... GOTY and all. Bazillions of positive reviews! Just who tf do i think I am?

But seriously. I waited for full release and multiple patches to get and play the game, waited until I had seen a number of positive reviews from people I trust, I and I still ended up with this disappointing, half-finished, buggy mess. I get it - the game was highly anticipated for a long time and a lot of you are just happy it exists at all. But you really deserve better. Here are my top three reasons for the big old nope on this game:

1.) ""It's so easy to explore because the game is so freeing!"" It's not. Not even a little bit. In fact, the only way to play this game without getting frustrated and/or wasting huge amounts of time going back and redoing sections is to do the complete opposite and follow a player-made walk-through. Turn the wrong direction and you're screwed out of a bunch of content. Click the wrong thing and you're screwed out of a bunch of content. There is a very deliberate order of events in this game, and if you don't follow the script exactly, you're doomed to miss a huge chunk of playable content. And there are no warnings for any of it. I had to restart my game twice just to get one of the origin characters in my party. Not everyone has the time or inclination to play a game 25 times just to see/play everything because the game was designed so badly to begin with.

2.) When I would get stuck and go to look things up, the responses were almost always ""yeah that's bugged, you have to go back and redo it this one specific way"" or ""you need to install a mod"" or people hoping the broken/unfinished thing would be fixed in the next patch (they weren't). This includes everything from the game's actual controls and UI, which are so awful I nearly quit within the first hour of playing, to the storyline, which most people feel is unfinished or tacked on in a lot of places. Once I caved and put a few essential guality of life mods in place, I would bump the rating up to a 6/10... which is ridiculous. Poor game design is relying on modders to do the bulk of the work for you, especially when there's only so much they can do to fix the broken stuff.

3.) Inclusiveness. The game was heavily advertised as super inclusive, but it's actually ""sort of mildly inclusive"" I guess I would call it? You can be gay and swap genders in the game - great, you can do that in Stardew Valley, too. You can also be non-binary - a step up from Stardew Valley! You can design a character with an appearance free of traditional gender constraints which... this is a fantasy world so should have always been a thing, but whatever. Of course, none of this has any bearing on anything until you get to relationships in the story where you are automatically locked into a very traditional sex-driven romance. If you do not cultivate a romantic/sexual relationship with anyone (and many characters are very pushy about having sex with you, btw) you again miss out on large chunks of the story. That means if you're asexual/aromantic, not only do you have no relationship options in this game, but you're also punished for your choice not to engage in something problematic for you. One character will even go so far to ""mom at Thanksgiving"" you about why you're not in a relationship yet. It should have been the easiest thing in the world to make some of the ""romantic"" scenes into ""bestie"" scenes when you reach high enough approval (insert comment about how even Stardew Valley does this) but nope. If you want to get any insight into a character's back story, you will watching a sex scene play out and you will like it. (Wait, how can you not like it - everyone else likes it!?!?!)

I'm determined to finish the game because of sunk cost (time) and also sunk cost (money) - it ain't a cheap game, after all. But I am genuinely disappointed with this one, and honestly, a lot of the hours I show as played were when I left the game on pause while I wandered off to do laundry or wash dishes because that seemed more interesting and less frustrating that continuing to play. Plus the constant redos and wasting time trying to organize stuff because the UI is so clunky... I would say my actual playtime is about a third of what Steam shows.",1720203824,1720203824,False,9,1,0.5089285969734191,0,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,negative,100

There's a lot left to be desired from the character building that BG3 seems to lack. I am not saying its a bad game, I am saying it was not ready to be released the way it was. I really enjoyed DOS2, and I find myself wanting to play that more. I think Early Access is going to be the same with most games, where developers focus on what select group of people want rather than telling the story they should tell leaving a lot to be desired. Now, we have so many unsatisfied players in the community because this NPC doesn't receive the same attention as another NPC. I think early access is a great tool for getting rid of bugs and the like, but when the first act was worked on leaving 2 & 3 left unpolished after release, it feels wrong. 

My first play through of act 1 in early access was incredibly enjoyable, and I looked forward to seeing the second act but I feel like the intentions between act 1 and 2 were quite different. I also feel like the story took a different turn then what i was expecting. A lot of things were changed. 

All in all, I want Larian to start making stories without the input. Like older games, they were just games and you played them, and that was it, you didn't really have a say in every single detail you know? Perhaps the next game they focus on they return to their roots, that's just it really.


EDIT: I finally finished the the entirety of the game. I personally struggled with the last act the most, so while I had my criticism of Act 2 being left unpolished with act 3, I did like act 2 a lot more. Act 3 kept pulling my attention in every direction that it was a whiplash. I was constantly worrying about what I should do before being locked into the end.

This game is a beautifully presented D&D setting, where the DM is a bratty teenager who'll happily tell you that they've  read the whoooole campaign setting and the dungeon master's guide, and thinks that 'fun' is what happens when the players roll bad and die 'because the rulebook says so'. 

It's DOS2, but with an entirely RNG-based system that doesn't work when you don't have a DM to cobble together an entertaining experience out of your group's failures. 

It's a very nicely written Choose-Your-Own Adventure book, where the whole thing could be vastly improved by excising the 'gameplay' - aka random dice rolls - from it entirely and putting the (clearly well put-together) story back in the right order. 

Combat is the worst part, which is bad I imagine because it probably provides the most core gameplay for most people. I haven't reached the end-game (and probably never will), but the current combat loop is: cast a spell, miss, repeat until you run out of spell slots. Go into close combat and repeatedly miss opponents, even if your meaty, melee-build half-orcis a higher level with better stats than their wimpy ranged goblin. Get beaten. Reload, then savescum the preceding dialogue check to avoid the fight. Repeat. 

If you're the type of person who likes to min-max your D&D character to breaking point, you'll have the opportunity to do that here and probably love it. If you're like me, and you want to consistently roleplay a character, as part of an experience that's curated to be enjoyable for you, then consider finding find a D&D group. If you're after a beautifully-designed videogame with a reactive world that has actual gameplay in it, maybe play DOS2 or The Witcher 3 instead?

Many people say it's a great game...but when you ask what they like about it, they can't tell you anything at all. They just say ""oh it's good"". This game is nothing at all like the first two, where the characters were not the sole important thing in the game. The city of Baldur's Gate wasn't even the most important thing but you'd think it was the ONLY place in 3 because NPCs won't stop talking about it. 

Combat is god awful, where the enemies get to go 3-5 times in a turn and you barely get even one action. All the dice rolls are terrible even with high skills. Where you should realistically get a successful roll, you more often get a bad roll, under 10 when you need 12 or something. Dragonborn were a joke and just rushed into the game. 

The multiplayer aspect isn't very good either. You better make sure the talker is the first person to go anywhere cause if they aren't, some other character will trigger cut-scenes and more often than not, you need to reload because it isn't the person that can succeed skill checks and you can't choose who talks to people. Also, why bother using one of the companions as your avatar character? You literally lose out on all their special dialogue and their voice acting.

The combat is probably my biggest gripe. The 5e system is ass, it's too simple to the point of being mundane comparison to the Divinity system or Pathfinder 2e with it feeling like everything is very limiting. In terms of how it plays outside of that, the AI path-finding is awful for allies as they walk around ally spaces to waste actions even though if I baby them through it you can comfortably fit next to them and they're all so determined to walk into attack of opportunity. It also is extremely annoying when I'm sneaking attacking as a party, going into turn based mode and after the first hit is struck every single enemy has a higher initiative than the rest of my party.  Pushing is an extremely useful bonus action as it can create space in between you and an enemy unless the game feels like your successful roll means fuck all and just doesn't move them even though the blue lines says that they'll be sent flying. 
They got rid of a few arrow types from Div2 which is a bit weird.
Scrolls don't feel as powerful.


I feel like choice isn't as open in this game as it seems and as it's a video game will always go to combat, [spoiler] my triggering example is the Hag encounter in the swamp, if you get to her boss arena and sneak the woman out of the cage without being noticed nothing happens. No cut scene, no dialogue, no way to get her out until you start the final combat with the hag. Why bother having the cage interact with you if you can't do anything before combat? [/spoiler]

VAs, the performances are good but I hate the party members, just not as charming as the Div2 guys and gals
Graphics are good
UI feels slightly better than previous Larion games


Can't comment on the overall story as I didn't and won't finish but the world building through the map is very engaging and is the only reason I want to continue playing but I might as well just watch a playthrough as the experience is not enjoyable for me.

The game meets every requirement to be the best:
* A good world setting
* Interesting characters
* An interesting and complicated plot
* Good graphics
* Good system

But there are two things that spoil it:
* The setting does not work good with the plot. It is just not a forgottern realms kind of plot. Both the gameplay and superb for divinity series, but it clashes with Forgotten realms theme.
* The tempo is failed. It takes to long for the plot to develop so the player just looses the interest. It was a problem in Original Sin serries, but here, it is much worse. The number of characters and side plots i so large, that it is completely impossible to navigate withot quest log. And all of those are important.

The game overall i would split into different segments:
Story/storytelling, Combat and general experience from the game.
As a Dungeon Master and a player of over 3 years in mostly dnd 5e and also other options like pathfinder i decided to buy this game to play through summer since it won the game of the year award. And i have to say that i found the game frustrating at times, whether it was unbalanced combat (either having to repeat the fight multiple times or sweeping through the encounter in the first 2-3 turns) or having no wiggle room for the dialogue, usually ending in a fight or a ""morally bad"" option. The biggest drawback for this game is the lack of a real DM. There is nothing balancing the encounters or allowing you to do stuff which usually would not be considered predictable. 
I loved the story and all the world building done, it really was a good written story, i've enjoyed all three act's more or less the same, but the quality of the game degraded over time. Ranging from drastic frame drops to bugs which caused me to roll back to the last save due to not being able to play. The third act felt generally not polished with a 50% decrease in fps from the previous chapter.
Then we get into combat... and here my opinion is very critical. It was adapted almost if not entirely from DnD 5e, however the main problem is that the open ended creative combat in dnd 5e was not made for a video game, or at least not for this one. In many areas you have to fight hordes of enemies ten times the size of your party. This causes the encounters to be very unbalanced, you miss most of the hits you make at first which causes you to get slammed in your fights and forces you to pray to RNG gods for a good roll.Another thing is spell slots, which are a good limiter for magic when you get one, maybe two major encounters per rest, this didn't feel like the case for me, even though there really isnt any drawbacks from long resting it feels unbalanced and out of character to do one fight and go back to your camp (wasting camp supplies) and reentering with renewed stats. Later on in the game i managed to wipe most of my encounters in no more than 2 to 3 rounds which just felt cheap and boring making the combat more of a punishment and not an enjoyable mechanic. There also are limitations to many of the game's spells and actions. In a normal game of dnd players get creative, this game has very limited interactions you can do with spells and such. Another thing is that the game is unforgiving and often buggy, that causes you to lose turns or spell slots because you simply were bugged by a game, and it doesnt really feel fair. Most Dungeon Masters often smudge rolls, give players a fair chance in an encounter or simply improvise when a bard starts playing his lyre in the middle of combat and rolls a nat 20 on performance. Here the game is cold hearted and unforgiving, if you do not save every 10 seconds that is. Another mechanic which just ruins the immersion and any chance of story depth, quicksaving. You can save at any moment in the game and if something does not go your way just press f8 and restart to the point where you were safe.
My overall experience with this game left me disappointed. Due to countless glitches and unbalanced encounters i did not have a great time with the game and kept playing to give it a chance hoping for it to get better later on in the story. I also dislike that most things won't matter at the ending, you can change with whom you end a game or which way do you end it but mostly all options won't have an impact until the final act.

Another thing is that it appeals to the modern day TTRPG player, firstly your camp is basically a harem. then most of the players will get zero consequences due to quick saves and of course the main character syndrome, which if a player moves to dnd or other games will be hogging the game from other players or just misbehave when playing.

I like these types of games, and I was quite hyped about something that scratched that itch. However, this aint it. I know I'm in the minority here, but I genuinely think there are parts of the design of this game that are just flawed.

The mechanic where abilities have a set number of uses before you have to rest, rather than having a cool down, is something brought over from the tabletop RPG. And it works in a tabletop context because the focus is on doing scenes, you usually don't put that much time into role playing walking from one scene to another. But in a computer game, where you play the uneventful parts as well, it just becomes another resource management chore. I get that they want you to have conversations with the companions in camp, but it feels very contrived and kind of breaks the flow of the game. 

Having dice rolls determine the outcome of situations is great when done right, like in [i]Disco Elysium[/i]. But for this to work, the result of failure has to be interesting in some way – it has to lead to character development, or progress the story in another direction than the one you expected. In a tabletop RPG, this is what a good GM does since save scumming isn't an option. But in BG3, failure mostly just leads to getting stuck or having to fight lots of enemies. Not once have I encountered a situation where a failure led to something interesting, funny, or story progressing. 

The companions suck for the most part. They're all rather one-note, and half of them are just grumpy assholes. I don't care about any of these characters, I have zero investment in them. Overall, the writing is pretty weak. The setup is rather rote and heavy handed, there's no sense of intrigue or mystery here. Why even have the big fight playing out in a cut scene, why not just have my character wake up in a broken pod with memory loss and then having to puzzle together what has happened (kind of like in [i]Planescape Torment[/i])? The quests mostly boil down to ""kill this guy"", at times using persuasion or stealth to kill them without having to fight quite as many minions. In act one, you have a situation where there are three leaders you have to get rid of. There is no way to play them out against each other, no way to poison them, no way to convince them their cause is doomed, no way to turn their underlings against them by framing them for something bad… In the end, you more or less have to fight and kill every minion in that location. And it's simply not interesting. 

As far as I can tell, my character has zero friends and zero attachments to the rest of the world – there are no old friends, they haven't been to any places before, they didn't have a job or a family or anything really before they ended up on that ship. Your only motivation is to get the parasite out of your brain, but because we haven't really seen anyone turn into a mind flayer it doesn't really feel like a pressing issue.

One of the main reasons for this is the characters. While I appreciate the effort put into creating diverse and complex personalities, I find the majority of them to be annoying and insufferable. This made it difficult for me to engage with the story and invest in the character dynamics, which is crucial for an RPG.

In terms of combat, I feel there's something missing. I'm no stranger to strategy turn-based role-playing games, having enjoyed titles like the original Fallout games, XCOM, and the original Baldur's Gate. Additionally, as someone who plays Dungeons & Dragons regularly, I was excited to see how the game would translate the tabletop experience into a video game format. Unfortunately, while the combat system is faithful to its D&D roots, it somehow falls short of providing the same level of engagement and satisfaction that I've experienced in other games and in my D&D sessions.

I genuinely want to like Baldur's Gate 3 given its pedigree, the enthusiasm surrounding it, and my love for D&D, but I find myself struggling to do so.

I expected better from a game coming out of two years in Early Access.

My Steam hours played of 170 is deceptive, because my in-game save file is about half that at about 80 hours. There is not a quest, encounter, NPC, or party member that did not break or have significant issues during my run. In a single save file, I had to replay almost every second of this game. A quest or encounter or NPC interaction would break, and I was forced to reload a previous save. If that didn't fix the issue, I'd keep going back to earlier and earlier saves until I found one that wasn't yet bugged or with a branching path that worked. Many issues were never solved, and there were quests, plotlines, encounters and interactions I was unable to see through.

And these issues are present from the very first moments of the game and throughout, not just in Act 3. In the current patch, many issues persist, and performance today remains poor on a range of hardware throughout the game.

That said, the character and class options are very impressive, and combat is a lot of fun. There is a very cool fantasy tactics game buried underneath its many issues.

Edit: Patch 7 added a mod manager that corrupted all my saves. I'm not even surprised anymore. There is no reason for this game to cost as much as it does. In a word this game is underwhelming. It belongs back in Alpha. Since release I've experienced multiple game breaking glitches that all took straight up months to fix. Playing this game is an uphill battle against the developers that desperately want to see it fail. I've lost 400 hours, don't make the same mistake I did by trusting the devs.

My advice? Wait five years to buy this game on a 99% sale. A candy bar is about 1.50, and given that this game is almost as good as one, it'd be a real steal",1723235383,1731471177,False,0,0,0.4741379022598266,0,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,negative,100

1) Game is stupidly easy. No hard desicions is to be made.
On hard mode (tactician) you just boink people's heads and they die. Zero (0) strategy or tacticts, zero usage of consumables of any kind. 
Long rests are being used ONLY for story purpose, you never really need it. But if you do - they are UNLIMITED at any point, no costs, no consequences. 

For comparison - Divinity Original Sin II was pretty hard even on Normal mode, and really made you THINK your every move ahead. 

Balance in first act is especially broken because game pushes you to go to Underdark very early, and then all enemies are like 1-3 levels behind you

2) Bad equipment management both interface- and lore-wise
You get like hundreds of magical items, weapons, armor and shit, which weights like A LOT (because encumbrance sytemm is so fun), but it does not restrict you, because you can teleport your shit to the camp and back at any time, So basically its just tiresome clicking. Just make it x5 less, but cost x5 more, it will make sense. 

But not only that, you ll get THOUSANDS of scrolls, arrows, throwables, alchemy stuff etc, which also have weight and have to be distributed at all times.
How fun it is to have at level 5 10 fireball scrolls which you will never use because you will never ever have to, and you can wipe yourself with them. I can feel the LORE

It boils down to the factt hat you dont ever have to think - ""should I use that scroll r should I keep it for when i REALLY need it?"" because you will NEVER need it

3) Game is too freaking long and boring. 
I finshed act I in 130 hours (did not even went to Mountain pass yet) and I just dont want to play anymore - game iprovides NO challenge, is too tiresome, and most o the time was doing freaking INVENTORY MANAGEMENT and robbing traders blind, because they restock as many times as you want at any point and you have basically no limits on stealing",1720223319,1722854063,False,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,negative,100

I like the aspect of Dungeons & Dragons, but the restrictions on the world in this game are a bit over the top. Stores do reset with randomized items to purchase, though not nearly enough like a true RPG (potions refill but gear barely randomizes if at all). Enemies and random encounters do not happen in this game which removes so much immersion and surprise to the overall game. It'd have been better if both or either options happened where enemies did respawn or if there were random encounters that'd offer some surprise, XP, and unexpected loot.

I would classify this game as a deep-lite RPG. The world isn't really there - so there's little to immerse yourself in. The game revolves so much around dialogue and choices, and removes the utilities of surrounding yourself in a world. Although, what you can interact with such as using jump or teleport anywhere - is kind of amazing. Another key note to mention here is that you never feel a sense in which you can explore or discover anything freely - because everything feels so rushed and timed (and there are plenty of timed events in which you're required to find something in the world, do something in the world, or speak to someone in the world or you will lock yourself out of options.

Another thing I've discovered which is a lacking shame is the max level. Contrary to 20 being about it in D&D, this game maxes out at level 12.",1720212246,1731176226,False,0,0,0.5098039507865905,0,True,False,False,False,1086940,20250114_132020,negative,100

Easily the best game I've played in many years, and it deserves a longer review than most of you have patience for. I highly recommend it, and here's why:

Like many who play this game, this was my first ""Soulsborne/Soulslike"" game, as it is the most refined and user-friendly version of FromSoftware's game design ethos. I avoided the Dark Souls series for many years. I had a presumptuous view of FromSoftware and their visual aesthetic that made me feel this game was just sad edgelord material. [b]I was so wrong.[/b] 

Like all FromSoftware games, Elden Ring revels in struggle. Only the most basic combat mechanics are explained to the player; the rest is trial and error. It challenges you to tease out its mysteries, not just of the world and lore, but of the combat mechanics and UI. The game asks you to [i]STRUGGLE[/i] (you need to be open to that to fully enjoy it), and oh boy, did I struggle...

I struggled to simply navigate the user interface, to find the extra info on weapon damage and scaling, armor ratings and status defenses, even item descriptions full of implicit lore that give the player a small understanding of what's happening in the Lands Between. I struggled to accept that not every field boss in the overworld was meant to be defeated when you first encounter them. I struggled to avoid traps and ambushes. Even when I gave up trying to play solo and attempted to use the Co-Op multiplayer system, I struggled to understand the seemingly obtuse system of items that enable it. Even after, I struggled against skilled and relentless Invaders, many of whom have been invading players since Dark Souls 1. I'm ashamed to say I struggled to not uninstall the game and play an easier one with a more forgiving learning curve. Such was my frustration.

Most of all, I struggled to get acclimated to the combat mechanics... Until, a whole 40 hours (and many deaths) in, something clicked. I started seeing and feeling a flow to combat, requiring a skillful dance between dodging perfectly [i]into[/i] attacks and identifying narrow windows for my own attacks. I started to understand every movement and attack option's purpose and viability in different scenarios. I started understanding how to most efficiently manage my stamina, consumables, and other resources. I started seeing challenges and opportunities where before I only saw difficulties and defeat.

This began a shift in my mentality. The developers were not taunting or trolling me, like many players seem to think; they were inviting me to experience a true power fantasy, to feel a tangible sense of actual progression in skill and understanding. The game does not say ""git gud, noob""; it says [b]""rise, Tarnished""[/b].

So many modern AAA games are released with a product mentality first and foremost, and not even as good products; they are often unfinished, rushed, bugged, and bloated with profit-maximizing strategies like microtransactions. Elden Ring is the first game I've played in a decade that felt like a complete game, full of hundreds of hours of content. 

So many games frontload their ""best"" content and force you to engage with it to force your interest, but much of Elden Rings best content is hidden or blocked by combat and platforming challenges. I have almost 3k hours logged, and I'm still finding out new things the game has kept hidden from me. This speaks so much to the confidence the developers have in their vision of an adventure fantasy game centered around discovery.

The game is not perfect. There are still some bugs and glitches present from launch that have no clearcut development solution. Many bosses, enemy types, and other assets are re-used all over the map to mixed effect. Some lategame and endgame content feels rushed and spread out. Perhaps worst of all, like all games with an active PvP element, the player community is rife with toxic players who seem hellbent on griefing others into making them uninstall the game.

Even with these glaring imperfections, this game shines like a diamond in a sea of coal coated with cheap craft glitter. It stands head and shoulders above almost all other modern AAA games in terms of intrigue, combat satisfaction, exploration, and story, and it doesn't even flaunt it. An understated and nuanced gaming experience is such a delight in an era where games are intended to feel more like blockbuster Hollywood movies rather than progressive adventures. Elden Ring is the culmination of FromSoftware’s singular and robust design philosophy, honed over decades of trial and error.

I am in no way a hardcore player. This is the only game I have ever played by this company.  This game pissed me off so much because I didn't understand that is was out the box a difficult game.  

I have since then completed 100% of the achievements and got through the DLC.  The DLC is rough but if you you just want to progress and beat bosses with ease, there are options.  Spirit summons, youtube cheese videos.

An open world is not suitable for this genre. The quests, as always in the games from this studio, are rubbish. In Dark Souls, they could be completed intuitively, but here, maybe 0.1% of players will finish them without guides. You practically need to get into Miyazaki's head to figure out where the quest character is standing this time.

There are few good bosses  8 come to mind, and it's even funny to call the rest ""bosses."" There's a lack of a coherent local plot, and instead, we get more vague, global nonsense about gods and aliens.

You have to fight all major bosses, get all endings, and find most major weapons. This requires at least 3 playthrus although I will say that you can breeze through the game pretty quick on NG+.

I still hear these words in my nightmares...
Other than that, I'd recommend Elden Ring.

I'm really bad at souls-like games but still enjoy them. 
Can't dump 1000 hours into any of these games to ""git gud"", so I thought I would give Elden Ring a try. 
I've read that it's a bit more forgiving than Dark Souls or Bloodborne, still challenging but not in a ""git gud""-kinda way.

These articles and comments were right.
While I still struggled at a few points, it never felt unfair and I was never ""stuck"" cause of Elden Ring's open world. Whenever a boss turned me into tomato paste 30 times in a row, I turned around and progressed on a different route. Fighting a different boss, defeating him, getting stronger and returning to the other boss again.

I really enjoyed the game and I am looking forward to the DLC.",1711715248,1711715605,True,193,11,0.8798059821128845,0,True,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,positive,100

This game is the first souls-like game that I actually played from the start to finish. I tried other titles but gave up on them quickly after a couple hours. So first thing I want to say is this game feels more welcoming to the genre than other titles.

I don't know where to start about talking this game. Rich open-world, very rich combat, interesting lore, amazing designs... It has been a while since I really really felt excited to keep playing one game. I wanted to push further my character, my equipment, my gamestyle as I progressed through the game and see different bosses. Especially the satisfaction you get from beating a boss after using your equipment optimally is unmatchable. I actually felt that I rose to Elden Lord title from being a Tarnished that others has been looking down at.

Lot's of the content is actually optional to progress in the game, and I usually skip most of optional stuff in other titles because they are mostly unpleasant chores. I felt different while playing Elden Ring, I actually tried my best to not miss anything at all. I wanted to see what every loot is, what enemies or mini bosses I could see and what missions I could progress. I could agree that NPC quests are a little bit hassle to follow and usually you might need to check wikis but I assume that is a standart for the genre. Even that really didn't bother me all because I liked NPC's too. They were pleasant to interact with and see how they progress with you as their quests go on. Even if you don't care NPC's I think anyone would still be excited to see what loot a dungeon contains in this game because there are lot's of fun stuff out there.

I found combat fun, it is still hard but they were aware about the game they were developing. Just go out there and grab those different items, spells, armors, swords, consumables... First it might be a little confusing and overwhelming but you quickly get used to managing items. Then fight anyone however you desire to. They gave you freedom with such a rich list of items. As you get better and your equipment gets better you feel the improvement on your way to kill your desired boss. If you are a hardcore souls fan you can also beat anything with a stick too.

Whole lore is actually pretty interesting but also hard to follow and learn. This is one of the things I assume ""genre standard"" so it didnt bother me much. Game doesn't tell you anything much, you read it all from items descriptions, NPC dialogues and other stuff like that. You also actually don't have to learn lore to follow the game though and just play for the combat experience. Another thing is game does not really lead you much at all so it might be really confusing and overwhelming. You can play it blind and keep wandering around till you find a lead or you can pop up a wiki page and follow it too. You might think looking at wiki's might destroy your fun but to be honest, as someone who finished their first souls-like game, it really didnt kill my joy because it is better than being stuck somewhere for hours you know. This game is a long journey and you'll get the hang of it, you just might need a little bit patience and help first couple hours.

Recent open-world games mostly felt %80 empty for me, but this game is different. Almost every part is a delightful adventure. I am both content and happy with the money and time I spent with this game, which is a rare feeling actually nowadays especially with the new titles. Even if you are not acquainted with genre, just don't hesitate and jump for a pleasurable adventure. Go wander out there and find your favorite equipment, find your favorite boss to fight with. Just sit and enjoy how a spirit of fighting rises within you as you progress through game. I am sure most people can enjoy this game as I think this game is really a welcoming and pleasuring one. I personally liked this game so much that now most of the other games that I play now feels dull. I am planning on buying the DLC now.


A protracted and tough adventure awaits you, Tarnished Warrior. Do not give into despair and keep fighting, be assured that you will soon be blessed with contentment.

Across my years of gaming, few experiences have truly surprised me. But exploring the Lands Between brought back a childlike sense of wonder.

The lore, characters, and world-building pulled me in completely, leaving me hanging on every word spoken and each scrap of text uncovered.
The difficulty was never unfair; instead, it pushed me to adapt, learn new strategies, and grow, rather than simply banging my head against the wall. 

In the end, the greatest gift Elden Ring gave me wasn’t only its unforgettable journey—it was opening the door to FromSoftware’s rich back catalog and a world of Souls-like adventures just waiting to be explored.

If you heard about the DLC and are thinking ""yeah, maybe now is the time I'll finally dive in"", then this is directed at you.

Elden Ring is not for everyone. If you don't respect the grind, then it will kick the shit out of you without remorse. There is no easy mode, no save-scumming, no cheat codes, and absolutely no hand holding. Yeah sure.. you can rely on Youtubers and Wiki pages to tell you what some of the ULTIMATE BUILDS might be... but even if you're relying on a crutch like that, you STILL have to put the work in and ""git gud"" when it's all said and done. It also takes a while to even get access to all the weapons/gear that those guides expect you to be using, not to mention earning the experience needed for the build to be viable. So my suggestion to you is to worry less about building an exact carbon copy of a character that some other person already played as, and just try to take it all in and experience it for yourself first.

I got every achievement, defeated every boss, and it was the most rewarding grind I've ever embarked upon in a game. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, but I learned from every single one of them. I got my ass kicked every time I booted up the game, but every triumph I celebrated was unlike any other thanks to all of those ass-kickings. From the hardest boss fights to the most annoying mobs, you truly feel every single victory... and that's where I got hooked because the sense of accomplishment you get from progressing in Elden Ring... I'm telling you, it is the ultimate dopamine shot.

Now, I personally loved the story, but it's definitely a subjective experience. Elden Ring is a mythological story about gods and demi-gods, and if you take the time to read through the item descriptions, look closer at the game world, and try to fill in the gaps kind of like a detective would, then you will probably enjoy it too. If you are expecting the cutscenes to be the only thing you have to pay attention to in order to know what's going on, you might be disappointed. 

Without a quest menu or anything like that to keep track of things, the game forces you to do your own due diligence and keep track of the NPCs you've spoken to, and to really listen to what they say because completing side quests isn't like most open world games that just plop a waypoint down for you to walk to after you've skipped all the dialogue. You need to listen and think about it, and if you've already progressed through certain points of the main-story, then you might not even get to experience some of the side quests. This aspect of Elden Ring can be a bit frustrating because you really aren't given any indication if you've missed a part of a quest or if you missed a quest entirely until it's too late. I will just say that if you're bee-lining it straight to the main bosses, you are definitely missing a LOT of what makes the game so good (and you're also missing out on side quests that lead to valuable ITEMS and EXPERIENCE!!!). So if you don't want to miss anything, my advice is to take it all very slow, and just try to clear regions and talk to everyone you see before moving on to new areas. If you think you missed stuff, keep in mind that you can always try again in NG+. 

Multiplayer is completely optional, but opting in to allow invasions can be rewarding because testing your build against actual players is pretty fun, plus you get to also see what other people are doing with their characters. Sometimes seeing someone else in action can inspire you to try new stuff, or it can make you aware of a flaw in your own character. I will say that I personally played with the player messages turned off though because I didn't want to read possible spoilers, and I felt reading messages left by other players all over the place broke my immersion.. but to each their own.

If you've never played Elden Ring before and are finally considering a run through the game for the first time... I truly envy you because I would do anything to wipe my memory and play it again for the first time. It is a game like no other, and it will test you in more ways than one. Just don't get discouraged when you hit a wall.. because we've ALL been there... all you have to do is learn to overcome it.

Elden Ring is essentially a culmination of everything FromSoftware has refined over the years in their previous titles, wrapped in a vast open world that invites exploration and discovery. If I could describe Elden Ring in one word, it would be ""Lost."" Like other FromSoftware games, this one is filled with moments where you’re not entirely sure what you’re doing, who the enemies are that you’re fighting, why they’re there, where you should go, or what the correct path is. Yet, that sense of being lost isn’t frustrating; it’s a driving force that pushes you to keep going. There’s something magnetic that urges you to press forward, to explore every corner of the map in search of an NPC, an item, or any clue that might give you some direction. But as you progress, things only become more convoluted. When you finally defeat an enemy, a tougher one appears. When you think you’ve grasped a part of the lore, new information emerges that forces you to rethink everything. The game constantly keeps you in a state of uncertainty, wondering whether you’ve taken the right path or strayed into a dangerous detour.
The only clear indicators of progress in Elden Ring are the boss fights, a few scattered dialogues, and some of the graces placed across the map. The sense of accomplishment from defeating a boss is unparalleled, it serves as a reminder that despite the confusion and challenges, you are making progress.

One of the standout aspects of Elden Ring is the sheer size and richness of its world. In open-world games, I’ve always enjoyed exploring every last corner of each zone, and this title was no exception. The world’s vastness, both visually and in terms of content, is impressive. The thrill of discovering a new area or finding a well-hidden secret is what drives me to keep playing. However, as I explored, I encountered one of the game’s most criticized aspects: repeated bosses. While it’s a common practice in some games, I expected FromSoftware to maintain their unique touch of originality. Perhaps the decision to reuse bosses was driven by the ambition to make the world as large as possible in their first attempt at an open-world game. Personally, I wouldn’t mind it as much if these bosses became increasingly challenging or had new attack patterns, but in most cases, the fights feel nearly identical. Despite this shortcoming, the overall experience wasn’t “tarnished” (xD), I thoroughly enjoyed every battle, striving to improve with each encounter.

When I first accessed the expansion, I thought it would be similar to the DLCs in the studio’s other games: having a high level would be enough… I was wrong. Erdtree introduces a unique mechanic that intertwines with the game’s lore. If you choose to ignore that detail, be prepared to suffer like never before. What’s fascinating is how this expansion not only adds content but also manages to maintain the essence of what makes Elden Ring special while expanding its world in a way that feels natural. Despite all the new content, both Elden Ring and Erdtree are, in my opinion, the most accessible and, to some extent, the easiest experiences FromSoftware has developed. That’s not to say they lack challenge, but the open-world design, with its emphasis on exploration and freedom, somewhat softens the experience.

In conclusion, I can confidently say that Elden Ring is the best game they’ve created in terms of ambition, design, and execution. However, interestingly, it’s not my favorite. Despite everything I’ve mentioned, I don’t feel the desire to replay it, cause it feels like a one-time experience. This contrasts with Bloodborne, my favorite game from the studio, which I could play over and over again. Despite being technically inferior in several ways, Bloodborne has an atmosphere and design that I find more appealing and invites me to a better ""dream"".",1724031668,1724031668,True,90,7,0.8051639199256896,22,True,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,positive,100

--{ My Personal Opinion }--
This is literally the best game I have ever played.
Even after only playing it for a few hours, taking time to level up and enjoy the gameplay this game still gives me adrenaline after beating a boss. If I had the choice to change anything, I'd change nothing.

--{ Review }--
First of all, the game's visuals are incredible. And it's landscape is very interactive. See a giant with a battleaxe thousans of miles away? You are definitely fighting him soon.. see a massive cliff that looks impossible to climb? You most definitely can. Infact loads of cliffs like that have intense lore and precious items hiding right on them and behind is a whole new world you haven't seen before.
The game's lore is also very unique. Even if you might not get it's meaning the second you finish it, soon you'll realize how beautiful it is. 
Gameplay-wise it offers a classic Dark Souls system with a dodge, jump, attack, charged attack, consume and so so much more.
If I had to describe Elden Ring with one word, it would be customization. There is so many different things you can wear, consume, places you can explore and things you can kill it's hard to keep track of everything. It's soul upgrading system offers you so much freedom you may run any build out of thousands that exist.
Although it's a challenging videogame, you may also always come back. Stuck on a boss? Don't worry, with just exploring, you may uncover a whole quest line, that will make you find a piece of equipment or an upgrading material which will make the fight easier.
But don't rely only on weapons and level since since without skill you may not get far. Personally if you want elden ring to relax, use magic, if you want to have fun play tank.

--{ Two Last Tips If You Are Still Reading }--
If you are truly struggling at a boss, or a place or you are just lost, ask. If you have discord join the Elden Ring discord server and ask there. People there are very helpful and kind, if you dont have it, download it. 
I was thinking ER community is so kind as it's there on every piece of media, but i suggest staying away from it on media platforms such as TikTok or YT. Just warning you. - (Shout-out to ""Tyrone"" for literally carrying me in-game)

The game started and it was from the beginning very familiar, given of course the new stuff and the items that were similar to those from older games that worked however differently to an extend. And it felt like it was going to be an amazing adventure already. And it was.

The numerous locations were very different from each other, thus giving a big diversity from one location to the next. The weapons available seemingly having an endless variety and the smaller details like day/night and the weather, really made a big and good impression. I decided to approach the game like every other open world game i have played in the past, explore as much as possible ( in this case finding as many sites of grace as possible ) and then start exploring. And did i explore.. Searched every little corner, every hole, every dungeon, every plain and every castle, excited to see what i am going to find... Very nice variety, very nice ambient music, interesting enemies and amazing epic bosses battles. And for the most part, the game was great. But it was just that...

Normally with a game of that genre, like i did with the DS games, i would describe my experience, but this game is too big to do that, so i believe that just being one more voice stating how good the game is , is good enough. However, i would have to note some aspects that i didnt really enjoy and some that affected my time with the game in a bad way. Starting with the worst one, i played the game on Steam Deck and during almost my whole playthrough i was being put in offline mode, which after some search about it, found out it's a problem of the game, a problem that it hasnt been addressed yet ( i didnt experience not even one invasion for example). The other kind of issue i had with the game is mostly based on my point of view. What i didnt like was that although i enjoyed it very much, the npc variety, i found it lacking. I understand that this kind of games dont have npcs as a main point in their narrative, but still i would expect more from an open world game... Thankfully the world building ( change of day and night, enviroment, weather, item descriptions and statues ) and the epic battles thoughout the whole game made a much bigger impact and when i finished the game, i was left with a similar feeling like with the dark souls games... Elden Ring was great, but i was left wanting more. Of course more to do, more to explore, but also more to care about since the plot wasnt that interesting and i never felt engaged. Maybe everything being more ( despite we wanting that or not ) open world is not the the way this kind of games thrive in. It felt like Bilbo Baggins said - feels thin and stretched, like butter scrapped over too much bread... And the reason the bread felt still tasty was due to its many quality components.

An amazing game overall nonetheless and highly recommended to everyone,because of its nature maybe also even more to newcomers of the genre.

Transferred my game over pc and doing summons for people that need help. Feel free to add me if you need help with any boss of the main game ( i dont own the DLC yet )..

A dude bought me the game, then i had to pay him back if i liked it, and then I had to stream it for him and a bunce of others for there entertainment... I started early on the game's original release and went for a shield/spear & scythe faith build only to be ridiculed for it. But as I played and defeated every boss on my first try (This is a lie, but true story if the boss was a dragon), I showed them how powerful faith and the ability to send homing-holy rings of light at a short distance really is! 

But I met a boss that I could not defeat, a boss that had resistance to holy damage and who effortlessly beat me time and time again until i was in the high double digit number of attempts, and her name was Malenia, she broke me and i was less of a person for it, they told me to change my build, to abandon my faith to giving up on your build that I have had since I the start and never changed, and go for a bleed build og arcane heresy. 

All tho Malenia was an optional boss, she was the last one i had to defeat before challenging the last 3 bosses in the game, and with the humiliation she had made me suffer through she was no longer an optional boss for me, she was the boss that broke me and I stopped playing... A piece of me died in that boss room, my hopes and dreams, and I did not return to the game again.

Fast forward 2 years and before the dlc was released I again was forced into the game against my will. They mocked me, teased me for not beating the game, that I was defeated and broken. But they made fun of how boarding and bad faith was and a fire was lit in me, one that did not want to stop burning until I had shown them the true power of faith. 

So I returned...

Once more...

To the broken world of the land between...

And the uhallowed halls of Malenia...

Cue the main Elden Ring theme song. 

With no warm up, no new game, no changing of build, no try out on lesser enemies, just pure faith I went back in to pick up where I had left off. But this time with a companion, a friend that would end but as the main character in my story, Black Knife Tiche. I was defeated time and time again the first night. I spent 4 hours with minimal progress, switching between me halo scythe + Winged Scyth and the Black Knife.
I died so many times, over and over again, before phase 2 and right after it began.
Day 2 didn't start any better, 3 more hours it took, until, finally, Tiche got the final blow in on Melenia and I could finally move on.

The last 3 bosses went down easy, but in the blur Tiche was the one that got most of the killing strikes on them. and we beat the game. 

I was happy, I could have felt it there never to return to this game... but alas, they would not allow me. they forced me into it, to buy and play the DLC so they could have something funny to watch again. 

The DLC is easy, first tried all the bosses (this is also a lie unless there was a dragon boss). But my run ended when I got to the last boss of the DLC, he was easy until he got holy resistance and killed me effortlessly again and again. 
I was told that so many changed their build on the last boss, used a food item as a weapon and to not give up... I gave up... and left the game a second time.

The terror of returning to the game a third time, it sceard me, I was fed up. I didn't care for the game, I would rather just leave it as an open wound in my gaming library as so many other games. 

But... cue the main theme once more.

Now after months of group pressure by my so-called good acquaintances, I had to pick it up again because they were bored and wanted to watch me beat my head against a wall. I went back in, no warm up, no go out and try my skills against lesser enemies, no changing of my build. go right through the fog and into the boss room. It took 3 hours over 2 days and a lot of deaths for me to finally beat him with faith and holy missile rings to finally put him down. With the cheers of the people watching me i quitted the game and uninstalled it as fast as I could. 

155+ hours on that on faith character and 208 level ups, I am done with this game and i will not play it again, the anger, the anxiety, the pressure, the relentless nightmare, it is finally over... 

It's ok I guess for a game. 


It's not just simple like, or didn't like this game, not a simple yes or no, positive or negative review, its just to complex. Its a game that is more about the journey from start to finish and what you do during your adventure. My journey was one with joy, excitement, trauma, sweat and tears. And I'm happy for finally beating the game and not having to pick it up again. 

                                              ---------------Afterthought---------------

This review is now the thing that consumes me, I have edited it 3 times already, and I can not stop thinking about it. Is it enough, does it tell my story, will it help others? Is  this what the game left me with, a curse, a festering rot... a scarlet rot, that will for now and always be on my mind. 

Did I really beat the game, when I let it defeat me twice, did I really keep true to my faith when I gave up so many times? Maybe it would have been better if I never went back the first time to fight Melenia, I wish I never had, but I will have to live with that, not knowing if I would have lived a happier life without completing the game, and it is draining me...


TL;DR:
Was forced to play this game by ''acquaintances''. Played the game, could not beat a boss because of my fate build, didn't play again until right before the DLC was released, killed the boss that gave me trouble, went into the DLC same thing happened with the last boss, didn't want to change my build just because I couldn't beat a boss, left it again. forced back in, killed the boss and uninstalled it as fast as i would, will never play again (I hope).",1730237079,1730274032,True,67,48,0.7953297495841979,0,False,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,positive,100

For me, it was The Witcher 3 holding the title for years, but now we have a new Elden Lord to claim the crown, haha.

The lore in Elden Ring is something else. From the mind of R.R. Martin and direction from Miyazaki, this is not just lore but an experience of its own. From cool to mysterious to dark, every backstory of particular NPCs or bosses is different, making you want to explore more. Since I've completed the game with 100% side quests and main story guidance, it’s pretty easy to get lost in the woods or ruins if you don’t have guidance to chase the lore.

The DLC for Elden Ring is a game-changer. After diving into it, I can say it adds so much to the experience. The new areas are breathtaking, just like the main game, and the fresh challenges and bosses are a blast. The lore gets even richer, pulling you deeper into the world with new stories that make you want to explore every corner. Completing the new quests felt rewarding, like a sweet bonus for all the time I’ve spent in the Lands Between. If you loved the base game, this DLC is an absolute must-play!

Apart from the lore, the combat is challenging yet fun to mess around with, xD. It’s a typical Souls-like game, but here you get a vast open world to explore for new weapons, magic spells, incantations, and many more things to kill the dead. On top of that, every weapon or spell has its own visuals or ambient effects, which look stunning on high graphics—just like a visual novel or something. The graphics are breathtaking; the world is beautifully made and designed. From Limgrave to the nightmare called Caelid, haha, every area feels creepy yet beautiful.

In short, I’d say Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that Miyazaki-sama has done for us. Ngl, even if you’re weak or a pussy, you need to play Elden Ring once in your lifetime. Just like RDR 2, Wukong, The Witcher, and many more, it’s rare to find such a masterpiece these days that respects your time and money invested in games.

Elden Ring is a fantastic masterpiece that serves as a template for what excellent writing, gameplay, and environment design can feel like when done in great detail and when these elements interconnect and feed each other. No other game is as challenging, fun, and addictive as this title; Miyazaki and his team have truly outdone themselves with this entry in their list of soul games. 

[h1]A World Awaits[/h1]
If you ask me if Elden Ring is a hard game, it is not, and the same applies to all Dark Souls titles as well. The best word to describe these games is ""authenticity,"" as enemies offer a challenge based on what they are. Yes, a Dragon shooting a fireball will hurt, but it is a dragon, so it has to hurt. Otherwise, it would be a joke with wings. If there is something one can learn from these games, everything matters. For example, the number of enemies is a reasonable challenge, while three or four can be a quick death.

As its heart, Elden Ring demands precision, commitment, and patience. While an enemy in the open might be easy to deal with, the same enemy in a different zone, such as a close corridor, can become a nightmare. The player has a lot of options in what they can do, from their builds, where they progress their character and watch it grow, unlike in any other game, but in how they will approach a fight or a challenge that is in their way. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303604272

It is a game where bosses are more on the offensive guide than previous titles. You can enter the fog gate, and they are already springing towards you. FromSoftware has outdone itself in some spectacular fights, such as Malekith, where having a berserk-inspired boss with a giant sword that can jump into the air and throw slashes at you is not only a fight that makes you tremble with excitement and fear but also a graphical show of how the team has come a long way in animations and boss design. To experience defeat and try again is the means to become an Elden lord.

[h1]Soulsborne Meets Open World[/h1]
Elden Ring's shift to an open world from the secluded areas of previous installments enhances its best quality: exploration. As you traverse the vast, intimidating landscapes, the world of Elden Ring comes alive. You can feel that you're not supposed to be there, but like a mouse that sneaks into a kitchen, you push forward, discovering secrets and facing fearsome foes. This sense of adventure is at the heart of Elden Ring.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303603901

The enviroments being so varied not only visually but also in their layouts give each zone a distinct sense to it. The emotion you feel as you fight foes and the relief when you get to that next grace means that knowing where to go or not knowing where to go changes your experience with the game. Lakes with water that could drown you, giant islands with tornadoes, a volcanic manor, or ancient flooded cities are just some of what Elden Ring offers to those who dare to venture into the Lands Between.

[h1]A Triumph of Worldbuilding[/h1]
George R.R. Martin's influence is evident in the game's intricate lore and complex characters. I beat just the core game, but I was distracted by side quests from other characters. That quest became compelling and a facet of the game where I enjoyed progressing them and discovering what would happen to the characters living in the Elden Ringworld. Blaidd, for example, is a cool werewolf with a compelling story, while The Witch Ranni is a fan favorite, and her quest will take you to incredibly secret zones.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303603449

The game is also full of secrets, as I stated before, but the quantity of these secrets is so absurd that I beat the game three times by now across PS5, Series X, and now PC, and I keep finding new stuff I didn't see before. To my shame, it took me three times to realize the game has a crafting system...haha. One can play Elden Ring, beat it, and replay it, and they will have an experience that is still extraordinarily fresh and wonderful. It is a colossal success to fit so much in one game and keep the magic of what makes it special and able to last in the long term.


[h1]Multiplayer: a Blessing and a Curse.[/h1]
Regarding multiplayer, the game can be fun to play with friends but suffers from it a bit. Co-op can make boss fights into a joke, while invasions can sometimes be annoying when you invade someone, and they proceed to do a 1 VS 3. The core experience is to play alone and use co-op when stuck in a fight, but there is also freedom to play in any way. In a way, Elden Ring misses those fights in Dark Souls 3, where bosses were supposed to be able to take three players at the same time.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Elden Ring is a masterpiece that redefines the genre of open-world games—a title where all elements of the experience are worked to perfection and have no weak spots. A must-play for all gamers, whether a seasoned souls-borne veteran or a newcomer to the series, you own it to yourself to try this game and seek the unforgettable journey that Elden Ring offers. Be prepared to face challenges, frustration, discovery, adventure, and triumph.

And with a game of this size and scope I think you really need to get pretty far into it before offering an opinion.

I've played all the Souls and Soulslikes and I went into Elden Ring with expectations based on those experiences. But what I've found is that it's not really a Souls game, it's Dark Souls 3 meets Skyrim, and necessarily more Skyrim than Souls but with less structure than either of them. That's not necessarily a bad thing, there's nothing wrong with mixing genres, but I think that a lot of players will find their expectations challenged no matter which direction they're approaching it from. You could be an RPG gamer looking for an edgier Skyrim or a Souls player looking for something similar but a little less demanding. So it takes some time to get used to the unique feel of the game but beyond that initial learning curve it's a game with very broad appeal. 

It's a huge open world game, and coming at it from the ""I want Dark Souls 4"" direction, I've found progression to be slow and a little confusing. I've gotten bogged down at times exploring, doing side stuff, but then that's not really any different than what I did in Witcher 3, a game I loved,  and other RPG's. I've also found that when you focus on progression the difficulty ramps up a lot, you're clearly expected to take your time poking around, killing birds for arrow feathers, checking out dungeons, and so on.

It's this mixing of genres that's the essential concept of this game. In terms of other aspects of the game like combat mechanics Elden Ring doesn't reinvent the wheel, the combat is pretty similar to what Souls players are used to going back to the first Dark Souls. It has a plot very similar to Dark Souls 3, requiring you to kill a list of bosses in a series of different areas in order to unlock the final area and final boss. What's different here is that in Dark Souls 3 the vagueness of your goal isn't problematic because you're going to be channelled along in a linear manner. But here you're just presented with a huge world and told to figure out how to accomplish your overarching goal on your own, without any direction. 

So if you're a big fan of open world games and you just want to have a lot of fun roaming around, exploring, fighting a few bosses, without being pressured to get to specific goals, then Elden Ring works beautifully, And particularly if you have limited time for gaming you could happily spend months exploring the Lands Between. And players looking for a more structured experience can also have a good time here, provided you keep an overarching goal in mind and stay focused on that and as long as you have some sort of a plan for how you're going to get there. So one player may spend a lot of time dungeon crawling to get the runes(souls) needed to keep levelling and another player may just skip all of that and go farm for a while. Works both ways. 

And that's the beauty of it, it's intended to appeal to a lot of different gamers,  and it's done a very good job with that, particularly in drawing in a lot of players who haven't played a Souls game but are looking for something similar but more approachable. They clearly put a lot of thought and creativity into it and you have to admire them for what they've accomplished here. It's not a perfect game, there are problems , the various pieces don't always mesh well, but it's a unique experience, full of interesting content, and after a lot of thought I very highly recommend it.

Game developers should learn how to design an open world game from Elden Ring. The map is filled with secrets after secrets, dungeons after dungeons and many more meaningful activities that directly affect your character and progress. It's simply a genius game design. I never got bored throughout my 70 hours of playthrough. Not even once.

What made me fall in love with the game was it's universe. I have always disliked the Japanese style of story telling that how the world was just too weird and were filled with silly and out of place jokes combined with cringe characters. I just couldn't handle it. On the other hand, Western style story telling was more serious and had more intriguing concepts but were executed poorly and lacked a soul to keep me interested. This game is the perfect middle ground because this world was created by George R. R. Martin and the game was done by a Japanese studio. 

Only downsides of this game are it's UI (fucking awful) and they couldn't calculate Torrent's fall damage but those two are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and can be easily disregarded.

Also, how about giving an option to respec before starting an NG+ or atleast a fucking warning?

on a more serious note, this is genuinely one of the greatest games i've ever played and not putting it in my top 10 would be criminal after the hours of enjoyment i've had. the world is breathtaking, there isn't a single area of the game where if you stop and take a breather for a second or two, you'll be hitting F12 a couple of times. the variety of locations are insane. i won't say much to avoid spoilling, but i was often shocked at the amount of ideas they managed to cram into this world without it feeling unnatural. there are some traps in the game that teleport you to late game areas, and you'll be shocked at how big the map is, how cool the areas are and how the fucking common dog just one taps you. it makes it so when you actually reach these locations through progression, it feels really good to not get one shot or actually one shot the enemies that were giving you such a hard time. besides that, exploration is fun and feels actually really good. usually in your skyrims and copy pasted ubisoft open world titles, you just look at your compass at the top of your screen, and hold W in the direction that has the most appealing icon. sure you're ""exploring"", but you're not actually looking at the route you're taking. in elden ring, the compass only tells you the cardinal directions, so if you want to find anything, you either have to look at your map to see if there are any points of interest or actually look around using your eyes to spot interesting things. this gave me the same feeling i had with breath of the wild a few years ago where i'm supposed to do one thing, but i just see another cool thing after another i just get sidetracked for hours. the bosses are what you expect from a soulslike, tough, maybe rage inducing (if you suck) but fair. if you haven't played a soulsbourne game like i have before this one, this is easily the best intro you could have to them. all the bosses are great, the build variety you can have in this game is seemingly limitless + if you struggle too much on a boss, you can just go into the open world and come back when you're better. the only flaws i have with this game is that it's in a serious need of a questlog (it's not normal that i have to have the wiki open on my second monitor just to remember what a NPC said 60 hours of gameplay ago) and it could take the ULTRAKILL way of death. what i mean is that if you die, you click R, no loading screen, you spawn right back into the boss room. i fucking hated the commander niall runback",1710142935,1710549160,True,86,2,0.727704346179962,0,True,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,positive,100

[h1]My Journey (Spoiler Free)[/h1]
First off, I have only played Dark Sould III prior to playing this game... As a ""First Playthrough"" variety Streamer on [url=https://www.twitch.tv/euther] Twitch[/url], I am always looking for: 

1. Great Story Based Games, 
2. Visually and Immersive game play, and 
3. A game that will bring new viewers to my Twitch channel. 

For me, it doesn't matter when the game was released, as I tend to play games that are NOT zero-day released games. I want to play games that have been released for a while so as many bugs can be worked out of them. 

My Journey started into Elden Ring was one of great anticipation. After a few hours playing the game, I was very impressed with the Visually and Immersive game play... Definitely. The game brought quite a few new viewers and followers to the channel... Helpers and Trolls alike... LMAO. I enjoy talking to both types... since I'm no expert in these types of games and I know I will RAGE eventually. So ya 2 of 3 items above met. 

What is [b]Elden Ring[/b]... 
Elden Ring was released in Feb 2022 and is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with world building provided by American fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. Set in the Lands Between, players control a customizable player character on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  This realm is blessed by entities called outer gods. Most prominent is the Greater Will, who created the Elden Ring – a collection of runes that govern physics. The Greater Will's emissary, the Two Fingers, made a woman named Marika the Elden Ring's vessel, ascending her to godhood. She then formed a dynasty called the Golden Order alongside a consort, the Elden Lord; two held this title: Godfrey, a barbarian who was later banished; and Radagon, Marika's male alter-ego. She also planted a massive, golden tree called the Erdtree that empowers the realm's inhabitants. Finally, Marika removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring and entrusted it to her bodyguard, Maliketh, causing the deceased not to pass on but to be reborn through the Erdtree instead. However, the Golden Order also persecuted certain races: the Omens, horned human-animal hybrids, and people called Tarnished, humans not empowered by the Erdtree who were exiled from the Lands Between.

Play the game from here... The story is great, too. You just have to take the time and play as many side quests as you can for added content. (3 of 3)... 

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
This game is worth a SALE price. It was very stabe and the DLC Shadow of the Erdtree... again, very impressive, a ton of content... totally fun and worth the dollars to game play ratio.  

Add this to your library. Learn the fighting system. It should not take you to long. Also, a bit of advice when fighting the BOSSES... they all have a weakness and if you take the time to solve the riddle, you 
can beat them all. 

I found this to be a very interesting moment in the game. Was very suprised: Chanting Winged Dame

Not the best combat out there, you will die, and i mean, a lot. Elden Ring is so rewarding, so fulfilling.
You will have to go back and forth multiple times, because you are probably under-level, but that's why this game is so unique and special. I never thought i would like souls-like games, but exploring this open-world is something i have never seen in any other videogame ever before. it is truly remarkable.
Every location you explore is incredibly built and designed, with tons of secrets, hidden places and doors, multiple precious items, and incredible views to see.
I truly think everyone should play this game, atleast once, in his life, it is simply incredible, something taken from fantasy books.

Just have in mind that you're most of the times, the victim. You will have to farm EXP, kill a lot of mobs, get good gear and upgrade it, until you get stronger, in order to go into new areas of the map, search a lot online, you will probably need it, as zones have level caps, but this game wont tell you anything, literally, anything, but well... i guess that's the beauty of it.
[b]
Be patient, do not rush enemies, study their moves and patterns first, then take your move and kill them, dodge or parry exactly in the last second, remember, this is Elden Ring, exploration is key, if you cant beat an enemy, do not worry, come back later.

Some people will tell you that Elden Ring is the easiest game from FromSoftware and well, they're right to some extent. This mainly lies in two things: first, the open world structure allows you to skip a boss if you're feeling overwhelmed to come back later, after getting more levels and gear. That's something you couldn't really do in their previous entries. Also, you have access to a variety of powerful tools: weapons, skills, builds and summons that can make your journey much easier.

You want to do it the hardest way possible? Great, skip those, you're in for a challenge. You could use some help? Use them or summon a friend to assist you. I can perfectly understand that some people have busy lives with work and kids and don't want to spend their game time wiping dozens of time on a boss, but still want to experience the FromSoft touch. There's no better way, just play the way that gives you the most fun.

The game is Exploration with a capital E. No symbols to tell you where to go, no quest diary. It can be intimidating, specially if you tend to have FOMO. The good part is that, by closely looking at the map, you will find clues to places of interest. The play area is huge, so is the content. At times i felt like it was too much, but at least you can't accuse FromSoft to deliver you an incomplete game.

Some graphical assets are heavily reused, that's true, but it didn't really bother me that much. Speaking of graphics, if you like dark fantasy atmospheres, oh boy, you're in for a treat.

That game is making FromSoft accessible to a wider array of players and it's perfectly fine with me.",1716803704,1716813257,True,217,2,0.8995767831802368,0,True,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,positive,100

The open world. And basically, Elden Ring can be your first, easiest or most difficult game from FromSoftware and it's up to you which solution you choose. It took me a while to understand that I don't have to run where the site of grace shows me and I don't have to fight every mob or small boss I meet on my way. There are so many elements that allow us to trivialize the game and bring it to a critical state where we can defeat the boss on the first try (and the game becomes easy at this point, maybe too easy), there are so many easily accessible items scattered around the map, just waiting for you to find and collect them. That's why the experiences of Elden Ring players differ so dramatically and it turns out later that someone completed the game with a weapon that wasn't fully upgraded, walked only on the main bosses and only on 6 Estuses, and I could explore, look for side bosses, upgrade my weapon to the maximum level and the number and power of Estuses and have no major problem completing the game and the experience is immediately uneven. This only shows that the game can be difficult, but it doesn't have to be. 
As I got more and more interested in the game, I easily noticed that part of the Elden Ring community is a kind of... special social group of sweaty little guys who have epileptic seizures when you say that you defeated the boss using summons or generally didn't do it the way they did, which means probably harder, with no hit and with a stick. People are able to insult you up to 3 generations back for using normal mechanics in the game, which are absolutely not forbidden and are optional. Gamer culture is pure rot and no matter how you play, people will always find a problem with something.
This game has quite a lot of lore and it will take us some time to understand all of it and it will allow us to understand how much we could have missed while playing the game, but it will also allow us to understand the stories of the characters we have to face in the fight. The way Elden Ring is told requires reading items, listening to all the dialogues with understanding and connecting the dots, and yet most players will end up on VaatiVidyj's channel looking for the meaning of the fight with a given boss. But in a nutshell, Elden Ring is really a big family problem.
However, I don't think Elden Ring would be a good Soulslike for someone who has not had anything to do with this genre of games before, because I think the open world can quite easily overwhelm and lose a new player and also make each subsequent Soulslike seem too easy or too difficult. It's all depends how you'll be playing this game.

These games now have such a large focus on boss fights specifically, and the combat still isn't particularly interesting or deep to engage with.
You're still just rolling attacks and counter-attacking, with little depth and variation possible.


There is still a large divide between spell casting and melee combat. While there have been attempts to lessen the divide between these play styles, they're still so far removed from each other that the difference between them is practically like playing another game.

Bosses have completely meta-game attacks that have unnaturally long startups to throw off dodge timing, excessive tracking, blatant input reading, obscured attacks due to visual effects, or have such a specific way to dodge them that I'm no longer sure they were even designed with a deliberate defensive maneuver in mind.

The bosses still suffer from a variety of technical issues that were mostly already resolved in Sekiro.
Losing lock on, being unable to lock on to bosses even though it's an analog choice, input buffering still being inconsistent, etc.

There have been definitive improvements to the combat; ash of war, jumping, crouching, stealth, horseback, and stance breaking are all notable additions, but their implementation all leave something to be desired.

Spell casting didn't get as much of an improvement and still feels clunky and antiquated with the way you cycle through memorized spells.

Critiquing the implementation of the open world feels wrong, as it's relentlessly impressive and, in many ways, the best part of the game. Considering it's their first attempt, it's incredibly commendable, and it's led to some of the best moments I've had playing their games. 

That being said, it becomes disappointingly formulaic and isn't particularly interactive either. A lot of the time, it serves as a large, impressive landscape to meticulously comb over so as not to miss anything meaningful, since the meaningful content is packed right in there alongside some of the less meaningful stuff. The intended progression path through it is also unintuitive and leads to you easily to being under- or overpowered.

This game really is a sequel to Dark Souls 3 more than anything. I didn't like that game much for a lot of the similar reasons I have issues with Elden Ring. With each new game they release in this style, we lose more and more of what made them so unique in the first place.

The game is big, insanely big, giving you a lot of places to explore and always come back to something that you might've initially missed. The weapon variety give you a lot of options and allows for a lot of replayability.

I'll start this by saying that I've never liked soulslike games, and have tried some but never bought one prior to trying Elden Ring out. I decided to give it a shot as a personal challenge after hearing very good things about it... and I'm glad I did. I quickly realised this was going to be a once in a lifetime experience.

I think there is nothing quite like Elden Ring, sure FromSoftware has made plenty of games of the same genre, but this is their first attempt at an open world game of the sorts, which also translates to some rough edges, as I'll discuss later. I think however that the amount of effort and creativity that went into this product is absolutely insane and very different from the western gaming industries' standards we are so used to today. I will ignore all of the things that remind me of lord of the rings a bit too much for it to be just a coincidence, and tell you that the feeling, the setting, the environment, the vibe of ER are almost unmatched.  Wherever I went and whatever I did in this game demanded me to stop by, look in awe, take a screenshot and share it to some of my friends. I spent so many hours not even doing any quest at the start, but simply unlocking all areas of the map, trying to find as many sites of grace as possible, exploring all the dungeons I could, obsessively looking at the map to try and spot areas that were too suspiciously empty for them not to hold any secret.

Because yes, ER will not hold your hand with anything apart from a very basic combat tutorial at the beginning and some generic menu navigation tutorials here and there, so you can forget about a quest journal or map markers. Not having much experience with soulslike games I felt a bit lost in the beginning with some uncertainties about my goals and massive uncertainties about what I was even doing, lore-wise. But I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel extremely rewarding to figure stuff out on my own, as ER is a game about facing and overcoming challenges, even when it means to give up just to come back later with more experience... and better gear.

And man getting gear in this game is addicting, be it armour, weapons, talismans, ashes or just crafting materials, this game was designed to make you become a loot goblin. It is so rewarding to 100% areas or making sure you picked everything up from a dungeon, knowing that if you didn't you could've missed something really important and/or useful.

Everything you pick up serves in one way or another to make you stronger and face more difficult challenges as the game progresses, but that will only be half of the job. The other half is getting good at ER. This game isn't easy, and it never got to the point where it became easy even with the best gear ever, because some areas of the game are just that difficult. However learning a boss's combos and finally being able to defeat it after 40 tries is definitely a feeling very few games can deliver. 

And you can really be yourself in this game. Apart from the very awfully outdated skyrim-like character creation menu, the game has so many armour choices that you can mix and match endless possibilities, without even considering the immense variety of builds you can try out to fit your playstyle and overcoming obstacles, making the game's rpg elements really stand out.

Unfortunately not all difficulties the game throws at you are by design. Some, in fact, are objectively just [i] bad [/i] design. First of all this is a console game, ported to PC. For the more tech savvy of you this should be enough to make you understand what is wrong with this game, but if it isn't: 1) the controls for m/k in this game are an absolute joke. Crouching with X? Jumping with F??? Having to use arrow keys to swap your equipped items? And that super inconsistent finger-breaking combo to hold the weapon with 2 hands? lol. I saved myself the hassle and played on controller, but even there, as a console game, the controls were honestly very bad, not intuitive and led to a lot of very frustrating moments. 2) Game locked to 60 fps? for a 2022 game? I honestly bursted out laughing. Fixed with a mod. 3) The UI, oh god the UI and menu navigation. Can we not talk about it? The fact that FromSoftware has never addressed any of these issues with any game they've made, not even their new flagship, goes to show that they are allowed with getting away with a lot of things other companies would get bashed for, thanks to their cult-like fanbase.

With these hardcoded issues out of the way, you should know this game has some very unfair fights if you're using certain builds, but I supposed balancing the game around a billion builds isn't possible, so be ready for that. Another thing you should be aware of is the fact you drop your currency when you die. In order to pick it up you have to respawn and retrieve it where you died, and if you die another time that currency is lost forever no matter how much you had. Words cannot describe how incredibly stupid and awful said mechanic is in an open world game, and if it wasn't because of a mod to remove it entirely this would've easily been a negative review, as it would've entirely ruined the whole exploration aspect of the game, which is one of if not the best part of it. So if you're playing vanilla get used to always being broke, not because you're going to lose it, but because you're constantly going to spend it being afraid that you'll lose it. 

Having absolutely no guidance from the game isn't a 100% good thing either. If you tell me you've done all the side quests in the game without looking up a guide on youtube you're simply a liar. In fact, I fully expect each and every single one of you to have looked up at the very least more than half of them on your first playthrough, as there is simply no logic nor guidance whatsoever about where to go and what to do most of the times, with some things making absolutely no sense at all. The game doesn't explain a lot of important mechanics or items either, so expect to play with the wiki or a youtube video open from start to finish if you really want to get the most out of the game.

The game offers 6 different endings, plenty of odd, optional or not, twists and a lot of hidden secrets to unfold, but it will not care if you miss out. You need to be resourceful, attentive, adventurous and smart, or this is going to be just another open world game for you.

With all of that said, ER is an incredible game when it comes to world building, environmental story telling, stunning visuals, satisfying victories, map design and amount of content.

if you go into shadow as a veteran, youll absolutely have a blast, if you go in as a new player, get ready, find those scadu shards, cuz it feels just about as big as the base game!

hope to summon you in the future :D and if not? well hope you reach the final bosses, and comming from someone who used to rather start a new character then play new game+, the scaling isnt scary, play the ng+, its VERY much worth it :D

Twice, I respawned in a world with not a single soul in it, only strange moons over the empty wastes, power-washed by storms and God rays. Then I perished in a sapling. Why couldn't I hold a grudge? For starters, the Black Knife goth gf of gaming possesses a pornographic level of mass appeal: 80s fantasy OST, exquisite architecture, and every detail has a clear purpose: the prettiness of flower fields, the sick armour sets, the towering spires, the suffocating catacombs. Nothing is over-designed. Vistas are money shots but a random room can resemble a painting and the game looks awesome in action. All these flashy animations and effects, dramatic lighting! How the water splashes when a leviathan octopus leaps into the air, waving its tentacles. Abyssal woods, gargantuan hands, tremendous poop in my pants.

[h3]Diminishing Returns[/h3]
Every playstyle is valid, but I have preferences. I went with polearms and Faith buffs for versatility. No summons or mimics. These tend to break bosses and broken Souls are a sad sight. After all, what is the adhesive binding so many people to these cruel worlds? Suffering. Seeking something that would ease it is part of it. Souls forfeit easy mode and blaming it on the community's elitism is reductionist. Your advantage is built-in. I'm a scrub and I found mine! If, given the tools to express yourself through boundless gearing and stat options, you refuse to figure out how to mitigate the pain, hurt on. Alas, the balance is delicate. When you overlevel, you may miss good fights. Radahn was a pushover by the time I checked on him. Half of Leyndell was f#cked. I got carried away, seduced by exploration - to be punished for it. Mercifully, things evened out as I restrained myself to play on curve before losing more game.

[h3]Lore[/h3]
To parse a Souls game's narrative is typically its biggest challenge. I always fell for the poetry of fragmented storytelling, so consonant with the shattered realities. Having said that, here, the meaning isn't as codified. Your avatar, a lowly Tarnished, their kindred exiled by the God queen in the past, returns to the Lands Between to fulfil a bitter prophecy. Undergoing a vibrant kind of decay, much the land got encrusted in the blooming buboes of rot in your absence. The beauty one's eyes find in such a disaster evokes a semblance of guilt. Leave it to the righteous dogs on your hit list. Akin to a gloating Viking, you charge at the brood of demigod royalty, take their heads, and melt down their golden idols. And the Ring... what of it? Maidens? I'd do it for a donut.

While the plot is relatively clear, the quest design is obtuse, reflecting on the uncaring world. I guess. You'll be gently guided by detached characters who either dismiss your ass or die for it. They reappear at random, reluctantly sending you on obscure missions. Just to get rid of you for a while, or so it seems. This isolating alienation is so compelling. Who knew we longed for a dehumanising angle? Left for dead with our incomplete self at last, we become unstoppable vessels of senseless dedication. Is this a vengeful voyage of hope or the freedom of losing it? Maybe it isn't alienating at all, instilling a sense of being sheltered instead. Imprisoned, placed in a pocket realm of someone else's misery to soak it in like a napkin. For this intimacy, I play offline... Sike! My internet is trash.

[h3]The Lands Between[/h3]
I played for the sense of discovery coming with trespassing in liminal spaces, taking in the esoteric structure that's close to Shadow of the Colossus with its hurtful grandiosity. Don't get too sentimental, complacency gets abused. By unfair monster placement, traps, pits, everything! Getting to know this world is like walking in heavy rain. Despite the efforts not to wet your socks, soon there'll be nothing left to lose. The rain pours on everyone, but you're so drenched you become its integral part. Revel in that sad freedom. The world was designed for agency, not to waste your time. It knows how to fuel your greed for progress and adds that gambler's ardour to the process of not-so-aimless wondering.

There's always a shortcut to unlock, an upgrade, something to meaningfully interact with, or delve into. Lush castles of intricate designs, underground cities, wuthering heights, ruins brimming with spoils, and dungeons that keep the records of my failed platforming. The rampant recycling gets old after a while. You'll see the same bosses and crypts many times. A big open world invites big concessions, but it also lets players decide if they wish to participate. Don't like a particular boss or area? Leave it be for now, think laterally. To digress in search for power is only diegetic and it never wore thin for me. Everything is interwoven, stapled by the hardships, deepening what could otherwise be a laborious checklist ordeal.

[h3]A Good Fight[/h3]
The complex synergies between the mechanics carry the combat system on their shoulders. I jokingly describe its stamina-based nature as ""chain-smokers break each other's arthritic joints"". But it's a perfectly gamey concession. A good fight forces you to learn thy enemy's patterns while leaving room for reaction and preparation. It's a game of delays and commitments that teaches you to make split-second predictions and hone hard-earned improvisational skill at higher levels of play. But your best skill is patience. Enjoy dying until you go slo-mo and your efforts culminate in a spectacular catharsis after doing most things right. Most, for you don't have to fight clean. Healing flasks allow for mistakes and you're given a bunch to facetank like there's no tomorrow.

Regardless, combat is tactical and visceral, reminiscent of dancing rather than a brawl. A good fight looks like a chaotic mess initially. With each attempt, come more recognised patterns. Often the only thing it changes is that you die with a smug expression on your face. The violence is so good it makes one emotional. Except killing mini-bosses like trolls and dragons quickly becomes stale. How a hyena takes down a rhino, stick to the nutsack. There's never a reason to leave their crotch areas and the same tactic works for most. I pity the giants of this world, seeing them used as cannon fodder, slaves, or food. Now this! All the thrashing beasts are lovely, though. Tree Sentinel MVP.

And the main bosses are as good as they come. Some suck, but the general consensus is that they rocked everyone's world. All have banger themes and balletic attacks of hypnotic grace. Most of them behave: evident telegraphs, ample openings, okay hitboxes, short runbacks, modest grabs and tracking attacks. Not a lot of cheapness like adds or pits. Margit is body pillow material, I loved\hated Malenia, both Mohg fights are superb. Rennala is mid, albeit, her knightly sister Rellana paid her family dues in full. DLC bosses are fire, in all. Midra is so technical, rhythmic, and Messmer... well, his fancy spear shreds that cheap Triffid nearby. Guess who's ba... no spoilers, let's wrap.

[h3]Wrap[/h3]
Whether I clutched or choked, my hands were shaking of suspense. Elden Ring takes away your faith at the start, then returns that investment step by step, earned this time. You enter its waters a mentally deficient scrub, emerge a mentally deficient God. Go get mad, death-blighted, let a swamp swallow your runes, see your body torn by birds under the crimson skies. Weep when it's over. Currently, nothing else provides as a fulfilling an adventure apart from brain trauma. From's vision has been outlandishly ambitious since King's Field, their creed is one of travail. Their game is Aurora Borealis at this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localised entirely within your PC.

DLC contains extensive lore, along with new factions that fit seamlessly into the story.

DLC contains new weapons, new spells, new weapon-arts, and new crafting items.

DLC contains new NPC's, subplots, and game-changing decisions.

DLC is bigger, better, and more expansive than any other DLC from any other game I have ever played. I would compare it to maybe if you combined all Borderland's 2 DLC's into one and then doubled it. Has not only replay-ability and story relevance, but more than 50 hours of content by itself.

ELDEN RING has so much content and dynamism that you can replay the game several times experience a completely new game with different endings each time.

We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.

In all honesty I think the game is great... played it a year or two ago and completed it. It was super fun with all the different [b] builds [/b] you can do and all the endings to go along with it. There are plenty of boss fights with different sort of weakness, while you also have yours.

Along with what I've stated above, I would also say it's fun because of the open world and caves you can discover and off course the [b]lore[/b] of the game.

[h1] Things I never found fun. [/h1]

[b]The Elden Beast boss fight[/b]
Design and phase aside, a lot of players mostly took issue with the [b]mechanics[/b] of the Elden Beast. The boss, is large, moves constantly from one side of the arena to another. Literally, makes most of the fight require the player to [b]chase[/b] the boss rather than fight it. At a distance, the boss can also spam spell attacks. Which makes it super unpleasant to fight. 

[b]The Community[/b]
I think there's an amount of players and fans who are cool, but sadly I would have to say that it's ruined because of brain-dead people who tell you what's the right type of way to play and have some sort of god-complex over a video game. Most of Dark Souls community over the years have been known for being egotistical, narcissistic and think that they are above other players because they are playing a different build or whatever. Grow up

[b]Conclusion[/b]

If you can avoid the type of players above, I would recommend this game 100%. As I said in the first paragraph, for the open world and all different ways to play, I think this game has a lot of replayability and I don't think one stupid boss fight should ruin that experience.

In Elden Ring when you defeat something you are just glad it's over. Sad really. Only bosses I felt was amazing was Godfrey, Radahn and Melania. 

It might sound like I hate this game but I love it, it's healthy to criticize games you love. I realized why it feels more RNG and why the bosses just feel like they have too many cheese.

Positive aspects:

Stunning world and graphics: The visual design and the world are impressive.
Deep and complex story: The lore and the story are very well thought out and offer a lot of depth.
Immersive atmosphere: The game draws you completely into the world with its dense atmosphere.
Extensive customization options: There are many ways to customize the character.

Negative aspects:

Extremely high difficulty level: The game is mercilessly difficult, which can lead to many frustrating moments.
Frequently frustrating moments: The game can be extremely exhausting, especially for players who are not used to this genre.
Difficult controls: The controls require a lot of practice and can be overwhelming at first.
Low error tolerance: Even small mistakes are often punished harshly, which further increases the frustration.

Conclusion:

Elden Ring is a masterpiece for hardcore gamers who love challenges and are willing to invest a lot of time. However, for players who are looking for a more relaxed or accessible experience, the game can quickly become frustrating. But those who overcome the hurdles will be rewarded with one of the most impressive gaming experiences of recent years.

Following in the footsteps of Miquella, the journey unfolds across a relatively small map, yet brimming with layers upon layers of FromSoftware's intricate design.

Everything is executed to near perfection. However, a few elements prevent this expansion from surpassing the side content of previous FromSoftware titles and earning the moniker of ""Greatest Expansion Ever."" These include the super boss known as Prime Radahn (akin to a community-created boss mod), the erratic performance of the latest update, and the slightly hollow feeling after unraveling Miquella's story and motives.

So, the latest [b] Souls Like [/b] game from Miyazaki.
The game is very good, really addictive, but only if you play without guides.
The game has an open world, a lot of quests and quest lines of characters, as well as a large number of bosses, namely more than 80, if you take into account mob bosses and just bosses.
The game has very beautiful graphics, all textures are well made, the picture is even on weak PCs [spoiler] I mean those PCs on which it can be played at all [/spoiler]
But there are also disadvantages, namely the traditional online, in which you can not normally play with friends.
Of course, this can also be fixed with [spoiler] Seameless Co-op [/spoiler]
The bosses are very diverse, from the usual soldier mob, to the well-known Malenia or, for example, other famous bosses.
There are several locations in the open world where you can find various things.
There are a large number of weapons that can be found, obtained and used.
Due to the variety of powerups, weapons and armor, builds are still appearing and stronger builds are appearing each time.
If you have already passed the game, and do not know what to do, there are several options that you can notice for yourself
1. Go fight with other players in the colosseum.
2. Install  mods on the game [spoiler] you can get banned [/spoiler]
3. Set yourself a complication in the form of, for example, passing the game by pumping only one characteristic, using only bows or crossbows, or without pumping.

Also, this game has an extensive community that can both support you and condemn you for playing or using something they don't like, for example.

The most important thing is to complete the game the way you want and like it the most, and not pay attention.

It's probably the closest to an actual work of art mixed in with a combo of some of FromSoft's previous games.

The game's music and art direction is so perfect for the setting being presented, and felt incredibly immersive for me. The music feels as though it belongs in a movie with how dramatic and beautiful it sounds. Probably the best in FromSoft's lineup of games in my opinion. Elden Ring's art direction is also phenomenal in about every way. The only gripe I have about it, although it may be just my own opinion, is that some parts and areas get a tad redundant and some parts recycle enemies and ideas from other sections, but it's not enough to say it's bad. 

Open world in the game is also pretty interesting and does a decent job making sure the player always has something to do, and of course has some of the best vistas I've seen in a game. Honestly I took a little too many screenshots it's so good lmao. Seeing parts of the map that I couldn't get to made me explore looking for ways to get to where I wanted/needed to go, and rather than just being a straight shot to my destination, the game always threw a number of different things that would get me sidetracked and I'd end up going on like three other whole little adventures before doing what I set out to do. It's very good for an open world.

The gameplay, I think, is a great combo of Dark Souls, Bloodbourn, and even Sekiro thrown in. FromSoft seems as though they wanted to bring the best of their older games into one, and did that they did. It really opens up the world for exploration, brings out the most interesting combat to always keep you on your toes, and has amazing locations that allow for exploration so you can find different paths through the area with many goodies to find.

It's not going to be a copy paste review, nor is it going to follow a strict baseline. 

Quick note: will refer to the DLC as SOTE (abbreviated for Shadow of the Erdtree)

First off, kudos to Miyazaki and the FromSoftware team from learning from all their previous games and compiling all their knowledge gained over the years into creating this masterpiece. You can clearly notice design choices picked from here and there and trying to integrate them into the game, which somehow manage to blend wonderfully together.

Recurring 'soulslike' design elements as well, well known and (jokingly) hated in the community like the poison/rot swamps as well. But what's a Miyazaki game without any poison lake to make it traversing difficult?

Which brings me to the first point, the graphics. In typical FromSoftware style, the graphics are there but aren't too burdening - allow me to explain from a pleb's standpoint. Basically, the polygons aren't that crisp, looking up close at things isn't so graphically marvelous, however the fidelity is there and you without having to blink can figure out what is what, which is great.

[h2]Now the views, however, are stunning.[/h2]

You open the door to Limgrave and your mouth gapes as soon as you step out. It's absolutely beautiful, and you can see quite a few landmarks as well which make sense with the mapping system (i.e Stormveil, the Erdtree, a bit of Caelid etc). This will constantly happen through the game when (not all instances, however) you will be greeted by such a view when you step into a new area, be it Liurnia, Altus [spoiler] depending on the entrance chosen [/spoiler], and even in SOTE when first accessed and entering the Gravesite Plain. Every area is also very, very atmospheric, with great colour and artistic choices (you can expect Nokstella and Nokron to be indeed, starry and with a beautiful view). 

[h2] Exploration [/h2]

It's an open world exploration game with a humongous map. Lots of areas to explore, diverse in thematic and enemies. You also get a mount this time as opposed to all the other soulslike games. Jumping also makes exploration a bit more intricate and parkouring (platforming) will be required in some cases either for smart shortcuts, or flat out progression.

[h2] Equipment [/h2] 

Great slew of weapons to choose from, really, appealing to all sorts of pre-established fantasy roles and ones you can also make and bake yourself. The freedom is there with the stat system and the way weapons scale with stats (some better than other, indeed) however the weapon's scaling isn't the only thing that has to be considered when picking a weapon. Souls-fashion, coolness factor, the ash of war (in case it's unmodifiable) and how well it scales with your preferred stat also matter quite a lot (the last one might matter most in case of min maxing). Very good, thematic armour pieces as well which allow you to craft fashionable outfits or just wear full sets that look great. 

[h2] Combat system [/h2]

Focused on the classical I-frame (Invulnerability frames) roll, with enemies that can easily punish you if you're not being careful due to all decently packing a punch but easy to figure them out and defeat from clumsiest knight to the most nimble SOTE enemy. The addition of a jump button also makes some attacks and some AoE attacks avoidable via jumping if timed correctly, which adds another welcome layer to the combat. 

[h2] Bosses [/h2]

Allow me to preface by saying the story bosses are epic in their own right with great movesets that make the fights fun. They also come accompanied by brilliantly composed OST-s to go with their personality, the buildup until the boss and in the boss arena as well. The few quotes bosses have are quite memorable and overall make the encounters even more enjoyable.

[h2] Storyline [/h2]

Like any FromSoftware (Miyazaki) game, the storyline is not directly exposed. You get to know some things in the beginning, and then you will have to piece together the intricate story from multiple sources: NPC dialogues, item descriptions, cutscenes and environment in some cases. Bonus points for having George R. R. Martin working on the story as well, there are clear influences seeping from his previous works into this story as well, with a unique blend from FromSoftware making it rather unique.

[h2] DLC [/h2]

I will start by saying I enjoyed the SOTE story and the SOTE bossfights to the fullest, as it is a hot topic in the community now (due to the perceived increase in difficulty thanks to a more aggressive AI). The SOTE area is also immense in scope and could have well been a game on its own right under other circumstances.

The Scadutree Fragment / Revered Spirit Ash system is not the best, however. It's main scope I believe is to enforce exploration which is great, there's definitely a lot to explore in SOTE. But, with the nature of the game being an open exploration one, means that some DLC content, if not visited at the right time with the right amount of fragments, can become trivial and can make some character builds extremely strong, especially after the buff the fragments received.

With that being said, the DLC contains probably two of the best/most atmospheric boss fights in the entire game and probably from a lot of souls games, namely: [spoiler] Messmer, The Impaler [/spoiler] and [spoiler] Bayle, The Dread [/spoiler] with one of the harder final soulslike bossfights in [spoiler] Promised Consort Radahn [/spoiler].




Finally, a small qualm I have with the game is some archetypes being unexplored to their fullest which makes them lackluster in comparison to others, namely: [spoiler] Sleep [/spoiler], [spoiler] Madness [/spoiler], [spoiler] Messmer-Flame [/spoiler]. They are all cool in their own right and you can definitely make builds with them but not many tools to use, unfortunately. 


All in all, I would give the base game a solid 10/10 and the DLC a 9/10.

Skill trees are a clusterfuck, confusing, controls half baked. Gun-play is awful; every animation was stiff as a board, weapon sounds were a joke too, bullet sponge moron enemies are standard. 

Story wise the game flops too. It has the beginnings of ideas but essentially does nothing with them. Anything that could be profound is ruined by the intense railroading of the story.

The setting is cool, but that's it. A puddle miles wide and centimetres deep.

+ Interesting characters especially Johnny Silverhand, Judy, and Panam.

- Tons of glitches that will stop you from progressing your main story. I had a problem with every mission that required you to wait 1 day and you'll receive a call. Not to mention the T-pose, people disappearing and respawning out of nowhere, crashes .. etc.

- Awful gunplay and gameplay in general.

- Story becomes boring after Act 1 and repetitive missions.

- Mission design is so basic. Go there, kill this, and report back either by phone or talking to NPC.

The Bad:
-Most missions are 70-80% sitting there while people talk at you, with very little choice in how you want the dialogue to go.  Many conversations happen while you are literally in the passenger seat as an NPC drives you somewhere.  It's like a masterclass in taking control away so you feel less like a player and more like a viewer. 
 The actual gameplay parts of missions where you sneak or hack or fight your way through levels is so short it feels like an afterthought.
-On top of the above, story pacing is glacially slow.  The opening action setpiece that actually gets you invested in your character and the world happens after ~6 hours of tutorials and filler missions.  And this pace doesn't let up, I frequently put the game down and came back weeks later because it feels like there is just too much filler in between the meat of the game.

It can also be pretty immersive at times for those of us who like Metro style immersion when we play.

Unfortunately, the list of negatives is quite significant as well. First there is the optimization which makes my head spin. Don't even bother buying this game unless you can play it at max settings. For whatever reason, if you try to play it in 1080p it literally looks like a game from the xbox 360 era. I guess make sure you have a 4060TI or better to play at higher resolution which I was lucky enough to be able to. On the plus side, it requires much less power to run this at max settings than GTA V... an 11 year old game that wasn't even graphically impressive 11 years ago. 

Another issue you will run into are the settings. There are a metric ton of them and they randomly reset. I was going to play this morning and literally just played something else after seeing that every setting had randomly changed. 

My final complaint is that nothing is polished. This game very much feels like a million ideas, none of which were given the needed attention. The vehicles are not creative or interesting to look at, the cities are empty and the mechanics for shooting/driving are arcade at best. 

Overall, if you can run this game at something above 1080p, and it is on sale for like $15 you really cant go wrong. It is certainly one of the extremely few ""next gen"" looking games of the last 15 years.

How you pick a single playstyle and are stuck with it for the next 100 hours due to how the game is designed. How the open-world segments are inevitably followed by long and boring story missions you have to sit through...

Instead, this is a shallow impostor. A thin illusion. A broken promise of something that could have been revolutionary.  Instead, they went for lame style over meaningful substance.

Where even to begin with this dumpster fire?

I'm not even overly rumphurted over the glitches. I have played some glitchyAF games that were still funAF. Though, be warned, the glitches in this game, even years on, are almost crippling at times.

I'm not even going to spend much time harping on how CDPR just abandoned this game after one major content DLC, because there are old games with no continued support that I still love. Still, how much money did you make off us rubes, only to leave us hanging with nothing more to look forward to?

Nah. I got all my complaints in one nutshell:

I got bored. I went on a rampage. Runnin', gunnin', and laying out the bodies left and right. Gang goons? Check. NCPD? Check.  Random passers-by? Check.

You'd think after leaving a trail of dozens and dozens of unalived meatbags everywhere, something major would happen. Merc's and bounty hunters falling from the sky. My face on every holo-screen. PD mech suits stomping after me.  Heck, maybe even the Militech and Arasaka wanting to take a crack at me.

Nope. Just get bored, clear out an area, loot, and run until they lose track of and forget about me, sell of the scarps, and then rinse and repeat.

IT MAKES ZERO SENSE!!! Especially when what stopped me was not death or arrest or just returning to the main story for the grins and giggles of it. No. After a seemingly endless and unstoppable rampage, the game just crashed.

Oh. Also, the city is mostly un-enterable empty boxes.  Lots and lots of buildings with lots and lots of doors. Can't enter them. It's just meaningless backdrop. Guild Wars also did this.  It was ok for Guild Wars... because that was with game technology from 20 years ago!

Also, side quests are *yaaaaawn*. And, the main storyline is so on rails, it's like a glorified visual novel with faceroll across the keyboard combat that barely equals a quicktime event. Why am I doing this? Why do I care? What doesn't my character just say, ""Fong with this noise!"" and open a soy-lent stir-fry shop? Who knows? I don't. Nothing feel impactful.

Throw a knife and it automagically comes back to you after a few seconds. The whole perk tree got revamped, requiring you to unlock silly perk trees, and it has overall become a very arcade game.

The game's launch, subsequent patches fixing it, then the newer changes kinda show which direction CDPR is headed in. :(",1721314824,1727160247,False,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,1091500,20250114_132033,negative,100

I have been thrilled to see them get better and better as time goes on culminating in the Witcher 3. Cyberpunk 2077 has a benchmark that allowed me to find fantastic settings that served me well the whole way through the game, enabling a level of immersion other games only dream of. My issue is that you get pulled out of that immersion a lot, and by really silly things that shouldn't be an issue, but are.

The music for the game is great, the music on the radio is terrible, each station has 2 or 3 great songs, 2-3 okay songs and 6-8 garbage songs, if it's the future let me spend eddies to choose what is on my radio. One of the Witcher 3's strengths was its music, it unified the whole of the game IMHO. For Cyberpunk 2077, music very much fails it.

I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, it felt like a slog. You could go to a mission or a gig and then feel like the game is just talking at you for 15 to 30 minutes (while not building the world, just building drama) and then make you fire from some silenced sniper cannon in a mode never seen before and will never be seen again. This habit of forcing you to play the game outside your comfort zone and outside of the strengths of your build constantly frustrated me. Those missions or gigs could end up lasting more than an hour. I'd find some time to give Cyberpunk between other things and I'd shy away from missions or gigs because I might not have time to finish them.

There are also TONS of shards that have varying amounts of world building lore on them that if you want to learn you need to pause the game to read through, hundreds if not thousands of the darn things. I want to play the game, I don't want to take a history course in a place that doesn't exist. This could have been covered over by taking a page out of Fallout's book by having a mechanical AI voice ""read the shard"" while you keep playing, to keep the frenetic pace when Cyberpunk 2077 is at its best. The world and lore of Cyberpunk should have been a strength when it turned out to be a weakness, both in the embrace and delivery of it. If there was an in game audiobooks I could buy on the different subjects I could buy for in game currencies I TOTALLY would have done that while I explored the city. This is the theme of Cyberpunk 2077, odd decisions just piling up in a crash to ruin the game. There are tons of vending machines everywhere, let me use them to get the food and drink buffs instead of buying them in bulk from specific vendors and then ever forgetting I had them (I believe I complete the game with over 100 hot dogs rotting in my inventory because I kept forgetting to use them).

Ultimately the game is still a little janky, even after 2.1. I also see the blank spaces on the canvas where a much greater and grander game with mutliple DLCs was supposed to be. I believe Cyberpunk 2077 did not get the time in the oven it needed and it never recovered from that. Like Starfield I put it to you that it was supposed to be a platform for other products well into the future, putting off some of the most interesting aspects of the world for a future DLC that never came. Don't get me wrong, it is a staggering achievement in many areas and it is let down by so many little decisions that make the game painful to play. It is a game that is less than the sum of its parts and honestly has much in common with Starfield because of it.

I do not understand what all the hype is about. This game sucks and it makes me mad how corny it is, it's like a poor mans GTA.
 It kind of reminds me of the sequels to The Matrix, Over the top and kind of ridiculous with out how serious it takes itself even though the whole premise is kind of silly.  I was hoping for something really immersive, I'm just wrapping up Red dead redemption 2 and THAT is how world building, story telling and immersion should be. Every game dev who is going for a game with a large and believable world should look to RDR2 as the gold standard. Overall I do like the concept of Cyberpunk 2077, I'm a huge fan of Blade runner and general future dystopian scifi so I was coming into this assuming I'd like it but the balance between showing me a fully lived in world thats believable and trying to hard to seem cool isn't working out too well. It's also not completely failing either, not to the point where I feel like putting the game away. There are a lot of concepts I like and I'm seeing a lot of potential as the story and the way the gameplay unfolds so I'm hanging in there for now hoping for it to get just a little better. I can say at this point in the game that I'm a little disappointed with how linear it's been so far, from what I've heard it's supposed to open up to more open world pretty soon but god damn, four hours in and there's still a fair amount of hand holding and 'go here and get this, go there and meet them' kind of missions going on. Hopefully soon it opens up and I can really start exploring and get the sense that the city and the world is a living breathing place and not just a backdrop.
As far as performance I've heard a lot of conflicting reports on it but for me it's been pretty much perfectly smooth, I'm running it on a Lenovo Legion i7 pro with a geforce rtx 4080 and 32gb of ram, I have almost everything cranked to ultra and I'm getting a consistent 100+ FPS so no complaints there. I can say I have seen more glitches than I would expect in a AAA game with this much hype around it. Nothing game breaking but plenty of immersion breaking glitches, people walking though objects, people responding with dialog that clearly isn't right for what's happening, people clipping into each other, clipping though walls etc etc. It hasn't been anything that's made me want to quit at this point but it's crazy how much of it I've seen at only four hours in (insert Bethesda joke here I guess). 
The combat is okay, nothing that I'd get excited about, at least not at this point, but again I see a lot of potential in terms of upgrading weapons and body mods etc. so maybe that will get better.

Over all it's not a bad game, I spent $30 on it and I think it's worth that for sure. I wish they would tone down the ""Super cool"" aesthetics it's a little over the top and takes away from it being world that I want to participate in but I guess I should have expected that being that the name of the game is Cyberpunk.

TLDR
At four hours in I'd say
It's not bad for $30
wish it was more like RDR2 in terms of immersion and maturity but I would probably say that about any open world game.",1716434163,1728688580,False,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,False,1091500,20250114_132033,negative,100

I would like to mention it right off the bat: I think I had very high expectations for this game and avoided any content related to it so as not to spoil anything when I finally get to play it. But then again, the developers have promised so so much that it is only fair to judge the game using the ""high promises=high expectations"" method. 3.5 years later this game is still a buggy mess, although 99% of the bugs are visual and almost harmless, even hella funny for the most part, it's mostly the random crashes for absolutely no reason that make you lose your mind. The main story, while catching and thrilling, is very short. I thought that by the time you meet with Hanako at the Embers it's like 1/3rd of the game where you have to make a choice to either side with the corpos or become their enemy after which a huge crusade with or against them follows (with well-written characters to meet, setups, battles, intrigues etc). Freedom of choice is non-existent; at first there are strict rules set by the narrative only to be tastelessy and blatantly sharted on hard later on in the game in the form of countless plot holes as the devs didn't care. The world is empty with none of the activities that can be found in GTA games. Well, you can drink at a bar in some places and on a singular occassion play a game of poker as a part of Phantom Liberty's main quest, even then I am almost sure the outcome is scripted, and that's pretty much it. A total bummer as during the development stage devs continuously aggressively advertised the game as almost ""second real life"" never-seen-before type of experience in terms of roleplay and freedom of choice capabilities. said every NPC you saw would have meaningful unique dialogues, routines, that every building would be enterable etc etc. What we see in reality is a game stripped of everything but shooting. Aside from the main story, there are 200+ come&kill scenarios which include all the NCPD ""quests"" and the vast majority of side jobs/fixer gigs. You can collect 20 tarot cards and read notes and that's it. Then there are braindances... Whoever thought even one person would find this cancer of a game mechanic entertaining and whoever approved it should all never be allowed anywhere near game dev again. Speaking of cancerous game mechanics, ""quickhacking"" and ""scanning"" are both amped up versions of the ""witcher sense"" mechanic which is horribly cringe on its own, but somehow this game makes it even worse. I do understand the thought process behind those though - quickhacks exist so that poor bastards who use gaming consoles can deal with the countless enemies this game throws your way. You'd think at least you can take advantage of the beautiful city cruising around in your car getting all the aesthetic pleasure in the world but then you're dead wrong - while there are numerous flashy cars, they all handle like absolute $h1t, no exception either as I've tried them all and driving them is nothing but painful so I just resorted to using fast travel all the time at some point. I can not remember a single game that has cars where they handle worse than in this one. Also, there's that stupid and unasked for faction that is Aldecaldos, they only exist in the game alongside their respective meaningless quests that are mandatory (at least half of them are) so that you have a reason to go to the desert portion of the map and thus it is at least somewhat incorporated into the gameplay process. They do not have a goal, their whole idea is to live like bums and rob military companies and corpos and that's pretty much it. Then there's Panam who is an absolutely lame character who has no personality whatsoever and her conflict with the other Aldecaldo leader is very stupid and lazily made just to create some sort of tension between otherwise entirely bland characters. Having all of the above said, this game doesn't differ from all the countless looter shooters out there that much and doesn't have much going on for it aside from its looks and Keanu Reeves as well as Idris Elba cameos. The looks are unbelievable though, gotta hand it to CDPR here. Especially the DLC portion of the map that is absolutely jaw-dropping: every single angle, no matter where you are, is incredibly picturesque and worthy of admiration. The interiors are well-made as well. Thank God I figured that the pistols build was OP, otherwise I would've had to list the shooting mechanic as ""poorly made"" as well. Once you get the hang of it, shooting non-automatic weapons in this game is actually fun.

The game as it is now is a bit underwhelming. Characters are ok, story is cool but this is not what I want to write about.

[h2]Stealth[/h2]

[--] [b]You can walk behind enemies just fine without being detected[/b] unless you get REALLY close like until when you get the silent takedown prompt. I was walking during an ""assault in progress"" thinking I was crouched but I couldn't notice the difference, really.

[--] [b]Falling from a ledge doesn't alert nearby enemies.[/b] And neither does jumping above items like the trash containers. I can jump on stuff right behind the enemy and they won't hear a thing. I can drop from them or jump off and they won't hear a thing.

[--] [b]You can be tracked after throwing a knife.[/b] I get that enemies can start tracking you if you use a traceable quickhack, but by throwing a knife while crouched and undetected? I did not use tech at all. Make it make sense.

[--] [b]Enemies can ""discover"" bodies you have already hidden.[/b] This only happened when I moved a body into the back of a car (due to unavailable trash containers), and the game soon after that said ""Body has been discovered"" but there was nothing on the ground let alone in their line of sight.

[-] [b]The camera keeps moving in the same direction while scanning[/b] even if I actually stopped moving it. It keeps going in the same direction I was going but doesn't stop, to fix that I have to disable the scan.

[+] [b]Camera automatically shifts a little if you are behind cover and you are aiming/scanning,[/b] making it possible to aim your throwable knife from cover without actually moving out of it since the camera automatically does that for you, this is quite helpful.

I honestly want to think the game was not created with stealth gameplay in mind, but it has its own perk tree with enhanchments to throweable weapons and the ""cool"" trait that improves stealth... but then there are all these issues that just ruin the experience.

There is also exclusive dialogue to certain quests if you complete them without drawing unnecessary attention, so to me it looks looks like stealth was supposed to be an integrated part of how you play the game, but developed poorly.

[h2]General[/h2]

[--] [b]Main line quests automatically become tracked after completing a side quest.[/b] This is mainly annoying because I am the kind of person who tries to clear all secondary quests before proceeding, but the main quests keep getting tracked every single time and I have to disable them because when I track a secondary quest then both paths are shown and I get confused. The main issue here is that you can track multiple quests at the same time, just replace the old track with the new one instead.

[---] [b]Fan-service is everywhere.[/b] I am seriously getting tired of seeing ads and posters with obviously sexualised women. The game's first mission has literally you holding a naked woman and since it's in first person you see the b00bs up close. I just want to play a game without unnecessary fan-service elements. I don't need to see sexualised women everywhere as I play.

[-] [b]Some T-Poses[/b] here and there. it shows the game is not polished.

[-] [b]Some NPCs have clothes that keep glitching[/b] and you see random stuff on the screen as if it wasn't rendered properly.

[-] [b]Some animations are skipped entirely[/b] for example when you open the back of a car to put a body, it justs shows the end of the animation skipping the part where you actually do it.

[/] [b]Controls to select different dialogue options are the same for moving,[/b] which I found rather odd. You can pick different options with the mouse's scroll wheel and arrows as well though.

[/] [b]You only get a static image preview when you are checking which car to buy.[/b] I can't rotate it to see if I might actually like it or zoom the picture either, just a small static image on the PC. I got fooled with my first car because I thought I liked it but I missed a big detail. It didn't have a hood... I am stuck with an ugly car.

[h2]My biggest gripe[/h2]

[---] [b]You can't see your character.[/b] Although you start the game by creating the character you'll play. you won't be able to see any of that except through occasional mirrors which is in no way enough.
There are clothing shops, you can find clothes as drops from enemies or through chests, you can dress your protagonist however you like but... it all comes to who actually sees that? Not a single soul. 

Every time I pick new clothes or see shops that sell them in the map I honestly feel bittersweet because it makes no sense and is such a waste. I want to see my character in a new style but nope I am denied.
I tried using a mod that forces third person but shift lock is enabled which means that if I rotate the camera so does my character. And not to mention the ugly third-person animations and such which are intended for first-person. 

Also a bug that my hair color gets changed when I wear a hat, but you wouldn't notice this considering the game is locked in first person.

[--] What you can notice though is that [b]while inside a motor bike, where the view is in third person, your character becomes bald if you're wearing a hat[/b]. This is the case for when you check yourself in the mirror too; even the hat disappears.

Gameplay is fine, I'm going through by oneshotting with knife. It's saddening that I can't see how stylish I am though.

There's some fun to be had, but the game is clearly unpolished and these points need to be addressed.",1712528862,1714318103,False,0,0,0.0,0,False,False,False,False,1091500,20250114_132033,negative,100

A smaller world and more focused design would really have helped the game.

Don't trust anyone who tells you that it's good after dozens of patches.
Both times I started the game I was confronted with bugs from the get-go, like not seeing myself in the mirror in the literal first scene of the game.
There's still items floating in the air, T-posing NPCs, etc.

The entire loot aspect bogs the game down. As do the random encounters and the lack of anything meaningful to do within the sprawling environment.
In my second playthrough I also had the ""pleasant"" experience of deciding that I would do a hacker + ""cool"" playstyle with sniper rifles and shit.
I didn't find a single sniper rifle within six hours or so, despite having at least one plot mission that seemed geared towards allowing for snipers.
As it also turns out, playing a hacker is boring as all fuck. You are literally sitting in a corner and playing an idle game with enemy HP bars.

Even the guns and cyberware are rife with seemingly randomly generated stats that just bog the game down with meaningless choice. It would make much more sense to have iconic guns be the only ones you can find and everything else dispensed freely at merchants without any gating based on level or whatever. Maybe put different weapon categories into different shops and then add a little extra customization.
In fact, customization over loot would really help with the thematic aspect of playing a hardened veteran of the cyberpunk underworld. What professional depends on randomly finding a halfway decent tool in a suspiciously immobile hobo's blanket, instead of consciously perfecting his loadout and avoiding over-encumbrance like superfluous weapons and entire waggons full of literal, actual, trash that was on the ground?
Make me cut a deal with a corp to get the real good cyberware and then have some plotlines from me inevitably catching some kind of backdoor, instead of randomly generating an endless list of different eyeballs that range from ""1% faster reload"" to ""1% more invisible"" or something.

Some of the UI is completely fucking arcane. Crafting is shoved into a semi-hidden sub-menu. Weapons can only be equipped with mods if you have them equipped. Weapon types (Tech, Smart, etc.) have no indication outside of the tooltip, but only in the tooltips of some menus, but total ammo pool (I think?) is displayed on the weapon icons as if it mattered at all.
It's a complete mess.

The mere existence of an ammo pool in this game is so ludicrously braindead that I wonder if there was anyone who didn't live in a 24/7 delirium during this game's crunchtime. As it stands now, you have 9999 of every bullet on you at every time and constantly find ammo crates everywhere and can also turn used condoms into more ammo and then also spend money to buy some more.
If you are so worried about players running out of ammo that you make it effectively infinite, how about you just remove the fucking system?
I thought rupees in Zelda TP were bad, but this shit is next level.

The clothing system is bad. The idea of applying a skin so that you don't look like the creature of the trashcan is okay enough, although only necessary because of this game having this pointless loot mechanic.
However, some of the pieces of clothing are pretty much broken in how they interact. For example, you can wear a spandex undersuit and then apply something on top. Some articles of clothing show the undersuit where they'd normally expose skin, which makes sense. Some, however, apply the character's skin *over* the undersuit.
Also, again, you are at the mercy of trash can dives to assemble your wardrobe, instead of just choosing what you want to get more into the immersion of the missions.

However, the company and publishers who've made this game are a bunch of greedy cun7$ that deserve no money from me and won't be getting it ever again. This game was only special because of what it could have been,  and the love and dedication that people put into the mods for this game truly completed it, as when it was released (in a rush i'm sure for that stupid 11/11/11 date) the game was a complete buggy Bethesda mess. I only enjoyed my time in the game being able to mod it and try the things that other people were making out. Since this game's release Bethesda has continued their dramatic decline into money hungry sh!tshills. Everything they've made it seems like post the release of this masterpiece seems to have had $$$$ as it's sole focus. 

Screw the game, screw the story, screw the engine it's fine it works. These people disgust me and you should support them. smaller and smaller studios have been making better and better games, no need to waste time on over marketed, soul-less, money grubbing, bullsh!t like this. I mean truly, the last good games Bethesda made were PERHAPS fallout 4, and for sure fallout new vegas and 3.

Anything newer has been obviously reaching for your wallet and somehow worse and worse in performance each release. The games aren't fun, their engine sucks. You want to experience these stories? watch youtube videos, they respect your time and wallet more than these b@stards.

Curious if the old workshop files are still live with those l@zyCun t$ trying to charge for other people's passionate mod work. 

It's infuriating. Todd Howard is a POS.  I'd have recommended this but nobody will see this review, cause Bethesda missing half it's chromosomes and can't come up with a new idea to save its' life.

This comment is specifically written on the off-chance that some Bethesda executive or employee might read it some day. You suck, and you destroyed the love I had for your games. I  will NEVER pay you money for a damn thing again. My attitude has only been vindicated by seeing how awful Starfield is. Not worth a cent.

you made us care for Skyrim, you made us want to play it, and then you put such limitations on its supported mods, such as [i]""oh you should have been there during the special promotion moment, sooooorrry""[/i].

The only way you'll get your money's worth in Skyrim, today (2024 and beyond), is if you are modding it (and not paying for those mods). Only with mod support does this game hold up today. The core game is pretty shallow, Bethesda has gotten worse every year since 2011 and they have been subsisting off re-releasing Skyrim over and over every console generation, even trying to port it into VR.

People thought that Bethesda still had some gas left with Starfield, but it was another lie sold by Todd Howard.

I am an older gamer and somewhat of an elitist when it comes to decent RPGs. Skyrim had it's day in the sun, but that day has long since passed. Skyrim had some pretty graphics when it came out, but that's about it. Today's gamers don't know the joy of playing games that were hand crafted by artists, not suits. Pick up TES:III Morrowind, and heavily invest your time into modding it. The game will look as good as Skyrim, graphically, the combat will suffer slightly, but you'll have an immersive RPG experience like no other. Alternatively, just give Bethesda $30-$60 of your hard-earned dollars to keep them going.

There's nothing good this version can offer, it runs terribly, looks a lot worse, crashes are the norm, has a 4gb memory limit so you have to juggle your graphics settings and mods to delay the crashing that comes from just rendering the game, mods are discontinued or have less support, this is when it even has said mod because there's not really that many in comparison to the other versions, finding a cool mod and later discovering it doesn't exist for leg edition is quite the common occurrence.

Modding the anniversary edition is so much easier, even doing the fixes for some of the few mods that still don't work with it has been so much easier and more documented than whatever the fuck leg edition has for its barely functional mods.

It feels surreal playing any other version at higher settings and getting more fps with 99% less crashes, even at low the performance is smoother and at the same time the game still looks so much better, I can't stress enough how awful performance is on this borderline unplayable version.

[h2] Introduction [/h2]
after many years of this game just sitting in my library i finally decided to actually play it to see if Bethesda actually makes some good games since Skyrim is arguably the most popular one.

When i booted this game up and had to go through the intro sequence, which is [b] unskippable [/b] i just got reminded of the numerous attempts of trying to get into this game and the frustration that comes with it. 


[h2] Game Mechanics [/h2]

[h3] Fast Travel [/h3]
ah yes, the classic Bethesda fast travel system. i must say i'm not the biggest fan of this, it just makes the world feel more disconnected and unimmersive.

[h3] Quests & Story [/h3]
main story quests are kinda whatever and most side quests are fetch or target quests, but there are a select few that do have some semblance of quality content like the guild/faction quests or the daedra-related ones. still, most of the time i was mindlessly following the quest marker on my compass going from objective to objective

[h3] Combat & Stealth [/h3]
it's a very bare bones basic combat system. left click to swing weapon, hold left click for heavy attack, right click to block, simple.

stealth is a weird mechanic because it's very overpowered and boring at the same time. it only works with bows and daggers because every other weapon makes sound and instantly alerts every enemy in the vicinity.

[h3] Magicka [/h3]
very uninspired iteration of magic in a video game. buy or find spell tomes, use/read them, and there you go. you learned a spell and can equip it in either or both hands and cast away.

[h3] Crafting & Leveling [/h3]
again, very basic, very boring. most of the materials you can just straight up buy and thats probably what you want to do because farming is tedious and there is no way to know where to get certain materials unless you discover it by chance or progress in the main quest.

leveling is just tedious, especially when it comes to crafting, you just spam craft the best value item because otherwise it takes waaay too long, how is this supposed to be any fun at all.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

sure, if i turn my brain off it can be fun sometimes, but there are way too many things that make me question why i even play video games anymore.

this is a soulless game and i can't understand how anyone can see this as more than just a half hearted effort from bethesda.

It is, without a doubt, a unique and extraordinary experience that has changed my life and my outlook on it. Now, moving on to the game, what an incomparable experience! ""Disco Elysium"" is more than a video game; it is a form of art that changes the way you see politics. In real life, you can say whatever nonsense you want, and nothing happens, but here, every decision you make has consequences. It's like having a philosophical debate in a bar, except instead of discussing, you end up kicking inanimate objects, and you feel like a damn monster for doing so.

This game left my mind reeling, and I can't fully explain what it made me feel. It not only offers a fascinating universe filled with multiple plots and charismatic characters, but it also transforms how we see the consequences of our ideas. If reading a book is anything like this, I should definitely give it a try.

[b]Warning[/b]: Before diving into ""Disco Elysium,"" I advise you to pirate the game through third-party sites. After all, the bastards at ZA/UM stole the IP, and the real creators don’t see a single cent from the sales. Apparently, there’s financial crime behind all this, and they even kicked the original developers out of the studio. So, in honor of the revolution, down with the capitalist pigs!

You become more skeptical about yourself, making you question your beliefs. Although, in this game, even your own mind isn't a safe or trustworthy place. You can try to ignore your thoughts but they are too loud.

However, if you stop focusing on an end goal - in this case, why you came to Revachol in the first place - for even just a second, you can make living worthwhile and life beautiful.

The game tells the story of a drunk, amnesiac police lieutenant DuBois with his partner, the stoic no-nonsense Kim Kitsuragi having to solve the case of a reported lynching near a hostel, only falling down a deep rabbit hole once they investigate further. The writing in Disco Elysium is outstanding, not just in RPG, but in all of games;
the story of the game is quite thrilling and does use plot twists accordingly to advance the story and reach it to its conclusion, while also subverting some of the tropes of police procedural series, it is pretty original for an RPG to play detective. The themes of starting over, working hard to see the end, not giving in to despair, reconciliation and above all, dealing with failure wind throughout the game which gives it a genuinely mature feel.

Disco Elysium is a very, very political game, several times pointing to how the gears of politics not many are interested in shape the world and each nation and group's place within it. Instead of a good/bad moral stance, it is instead a political stance that are decided through conversations and although all worldviews are treated with intense scrutiny and criticism, are given nuance, so keep that in mind when you talk to someone.

The characters in this game are some of the best and most developed I've seen, with the two main characters, Mr. DuBois and Kim might as well being as iconic (and kind of reminiscent of) Holmes and Watson;
and the game doesn't stop there, every character, major or minor, has something distinct, each having their own complexities and struggles, having to deal with their views on you and the world, and ways you can get them to open up about the case and reveal the depths they're hiding, in that you feel very immersed in the game's setting. The characters don't feel like props put to a game for the story to progress, they feel like actual people with their own things happening in their lives. The voice-acting as well is done with great effort and since The Final Cut makes the game fully-voiced, it prospers.

The worldbuilding is one of the best, hands down. Taking place in a large but rundown city of Revachol put under a strict international military occupation following an attempt at a revolution, giving a rather powerful backdrop to the happenings you encounter along the way, the lynching becoming a small piece of puzzle in a much wider set, the world being reminiscent of ZA/UM's Estonian origins and its post-Soviet socioeconomic landscape. The developers spared no effort at creating a colossally-detailed world, with its own vocabulary, history and progression, yet very similar to our own, giving it an alien but familiar look that creates a wonderful mix of feeling like you're there.

It helps with the very good handling of the exposition, DuBois suffering from amnesia serves himself as a surrogate for the audience introducing the concepts slowly through the dialogue or the thoughts in his head, one is quite motivated latching for more information about Elysium by searching every room or investing in Encyclopedia skill to hear what a ""radiocomputer"" is. At the least showing the potential in setting in an different world that doesn't need to be Sci-Fi or Fantasy.

The visuals here do show the priorities set, the in-game 3D models are pretty flat with primitive movements, but is more than made up with the beyond moving artwork by lead artist Alexander Rostov.
The game's art style is incredibly distinct in that it doesn't look like a painting done on a frame or tablet, but a mural on the walls of rusted buildings, the game's landscape has a very painted-on look to it like you're walking on an interactive panoramic masterpiece, meanwhile the portrait of characters feels like commissioned portraits worthy of ending up on the museum, each one having different motives to it and what they feel.

I told a lot about the design in the story, but what about the actual gameplay...

The gameplay of Disco Elysium is... not that good. While staying true to the pen-and-paper RPGs and to me, it doesn't really translate well into a computer game partly due to lack of real action on screen. I will say it is very unique, rather than levelling up your weapons and armour to attack more enemies, you level up your inner thoughts that serve as your party members that guide you to a satisfactory outcome when talking to people, with a sufficient level passing a check where you can hear its thoughts.
For example, Rhetoric helping you see what are they trying to say and helping you better convince them, or Inland Empire making you have conversations with things that can't talk; crafting an extensive and thrilling game of shoulder angels. The skill levels are also capped to encourage replay value.
The issue comes from how it's not really balanced, most of actions occur in INT field so focusing on other fields can lock you out of many quests.
Then there are the checks, roll a dice and see if it advances the plot. While care is given to cases where the check is failed since the game is about accepting it,, you'd rather want the best outcome like in any other game and one could be pushed into save-and-loading over and over to get it, which kind of pushes down the enjoyability.

The good thing is that the checks can be curved by completing side-quests but not all; will say, even the side-quests are very engaging and can have twists of their own, even a minor one like finding and recovering a corpse on a boardwalk has its own share of gravitas. Problem came when it piled quests on me at the beginning and gave nothing to do with them until later, a thing that made me feel under pressure and got me to put the game off for a few months.
Either way, it is a game without much action with combat mechanics not existing, making it more like an interactive Poirot novel than what you expect for a game. If you're familiar with pen-and-paper, you'll probably enjoy this game a lot more, most of my issues with the gameplay come more from my particular distaste in RPG anyway.

The music, well, just by exiting the first building you're in, you start to get greeted by the game's distinguishable score. It goes in several places, whether the gloomy ""Instrument of Surrender"" or the Pop-y ""Whirling-In-Rags"" or the gratifying ""La Revacholiere"", it stays in your head. Just the soundtrack alone has its place in games history. Honestly, with a name like ""Disco Elysium"", I was expecting Disco music.

Conclusion:
+:Deep and complex characters, amazing and emotional artwork, otherworldly worldbuilding, engaging story, great voice-acting, distinct and beautiful music.
-: Gameplay is barren at best, frustrating at worst, slow and badly-paced beginning.

Disco Elysium has its flaws, but they can be forgiven easily by the marvelous might of its storytelling and the art direction. The game may not be great to play, but it is extraordinary to look and hear, and with that ends up as the one game I can hold to prove computer games are an art form. While it had its humble beginnings, it truly ends up as one of the greatest indie games ever made, standing on the shoulders with Cave Story, Papers Please, Undertale, Cuphead and such.

Perhaps even more important, because our mistakes define us and our history.

The game is also extremely funny and witty, and the text it contains is of top quality. Some have jokingly stated that ""Disco Elysium is the best game they've ever read"" and they have a point: the game has a lot of text, but none of it is empty or without purpose.

Unlike most ""RPGs"", this isn't a combat simulator dressed in metrics and a story, centered around a main ""character"" that is largely a hollow shell for the player to inhabit.

Disco Elysium is a masterful combination of outstanding techno-fantasy worldbuilding and superb writing which has you take over a flawed, unique character and discover him as you discover the game's systems. Which equal his personality and physicality, which you can mutate with each reaction to the game world and what happens around you. Skills are physical and mental parts of your being, and they chip in like characters of their own as your guy runs into situations; ""Feats"" are your thoughts and ideas, which you can foster or suppress according to how you want interact with the world.

It takes the age-old mechanics of tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons and twists them in strange ways around a macabre tale of violence, poverty, and a society on the brink of collapse. Through sharply written dialogue and an expertly crafted world, it uses some unique game mechanics - such as debating against 24 different sections of your own brain - to create a story that will stay with me for a long time. And, somehow, it manages to make all of this fun and, surprisingly often, funny. Now with the addition of a fully voiced cast and even more side quests to embark on, The Final Cut makes an amazing game even better.

The premise of Disco Elysium is straightforward: A body has been discovered, hanged from a looming tree in the backyard of a hostel, and it’s up to you to work out how it got there over the course of the 30-hour story. Everything that surrounds this core mystery is far from simple, however, not least being that you kick things off with an almighty dose of hangover-induced amnesia. You can’t even remember your name, let alone that you are a cop on a murder case. A part of your consciousness described as your ancient reptilian brain – which you literally engage in conversation with – attempts to persuade you to give up your quest even as your snivelling limbic system battles against it. As you stumble around your wrecked bedroom searching for remnants of your former self, it quickly becomes clear that this isn’t simply a whodunnit, but a journey that will challenge you to solve crises on both profoundly personal and societal levels.

Anyway, if you're like me—a somewhat illiterate person whose second or third language is English—and then get slapped with different ideologies and political theories you have no idea about or just don't care for, don't worry!

The game initially throws you into interactions with some insane characters (or maybe it's just your character?), which can be intimidating.

The game is less about detectives investigating a crime and more about uncovering your character and the major emotional themes that surround them - grief, loss, yearning, existential dread, alienation, dehumanization, being haunted by the past, inability to let go. And every character in the story is spectacularly well-written with a lot of depth and complexity, not so one-dimensional to be hated on for which encourages you to look in a complete different perspective.

The map itself isn't that big but it does offer a lot with side quests and many hidden details to find. Some tasks that require you to wait until specific time schedule to proceed which I find very tedious due to how clock behaves differently in game because time only advances through dialog. If you run out of things to do, you will unfortunately have to read a book over and over to pass time, but hey, at least that contributes to the immersion should you find a book worth reading through.

Unique, incredibly successful & perfectly executed.[/b]

[h1]Disco Elysium has earned three incredibly impressive, RARE distinctions in my opinon:[/h1]


[table]
[tr]
	[td] 1) You hear frequently about a game having ""good writing"".  Almost always this observation is entirely held in context to just video games. These games have ""good writing"" FOR a video game. They are good in comparison to other video games, but the quality of writing in these games often pales in comparison to the quality of writing in other mediums. Vast majority of the time, a game's ""good writing"" is really only exceptional within that context, but mostly average when held in comparison to other mediums. It's like an always present mental asterisk, that we all know and are aware of, but don't mention because it's just the way it is and we all understand that.

Disco Elysium is one of the very few games that escapes this. Disco Elysium legitimately is greatly written. PERIOD. No mental asterisk, no contextual shackles. Its quality stands firm for ANY medium you will find, and far beyond what you will typically find in a video game commonly regarded as having ""good writing"". 
[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td] 2) It is possibly the closest thing I've played to a flawless game in all my years of gaming. I know this sounds dramatic, and I don't mean to mislead or confuse so let me clarify. This isn't my favorite game of all time or anything like that. I don't mean to say that I believe this game is ""better"" than other great games. It certainly will NOT be a game for everyone.

Instead what I mean by this, is the examination of the balance between intention & execution. What the game set out to do, what it aimed to BE, [i]versus[/i], what the game actually did, what is WAS. I'm viewing ""Flaws"" as objective issues that directly contrast or betray the goal of what the game is trying to be.

There are other games with better visuals, better gameplay, superior animations, superior OSTs etc etc. But few I've seen, who so closely MASTERED accomplishing exactly the game they set out to as this one. This balance is so perfectly accomplished, that if imagined as scale, would look perfectly horizontal. Of the very few criticisms I did have, they were EXTREMELY subjective, so much so that they are more appropriately described as preferences then flaws. But none that obstructed this game from being what it set out to be.

It is, so perfectly & so exactly: ""Disco Elysium"".  If you understand what I'm saying by this, you'll know how rare and excellent a feat that is.
[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td] 3)""Unique"" has no inherent value in a vacuum. Unique for the sole sake of being unique is one of the biggest traps a game can suffer from. There is ""Bad Unique"" & ""Good Unique"".  Forced, cumbersome mechanics for the sake of declaring in bold ""But! We are unique! Praise us!"" can truly detriment and get in the way of an otherwise good game.

However, ORGANIC unique, where an idea is fresh but not forced, and works seamlessly is a whole different story, and one of the best achievements a game can have. 

This is the latter. A completely fresh breath of air, and an entirely unique, different approach to the ""Detective"" genre of games that I've never seen before. And yet despite it's unusual approach, never once feels unintuitive or working against you. It's organically unique and works in a way that is so satisfying, it will change how you view the genre.

Majority of detective games basically play as ""Clue Retrieval"". You enter an environment, or an interview and there is a thing to discover. You use the tools of the game, the game shows you the discovery in question, you retrieve it, you move onto the next thread.

Disco Elysium approaches this formula differently. You instead develop separate, distinct parts of your mind & body. It's up to you as the player to determine which aspects you choose to develop or ignore. There are no correct answers. It's your creation.

These aspects then all work in sometimes tandem, other times even directly competing against each other as they all contribute their respective observations & perspectives. Each able to sense or even misread things that the others can't. You don't receive definitive answers, you receive essentially thoughts, of which YOU the player have to navigate and consider. For example: A ""Logical"" oriented thought process can pick up some things that a more ""Empathetic"" mind would miss, just as an ""Empathetic"" mind may understand motives more then a ""Logical"" mind would. Too much of one can leave you too singularly focused to the point of tunnel vision, too little can leave you incapable of all the information that aspect COULD have yielded. 

It's not just changing how YOU interact with the populace/environment, but it also alters how the populace/environment interfaces with you. It's a fascinating dynamic that quickly begins to feel natural and immersive. Perspective is everything and the people/environments and the literal entire game itself drastically changes depending on how you build & maintain this dynamic, opening entire new methods, secrets & possibilities.

Quite literally a game changer and possibly, HOPEFULLY a system that will prove to be influential to the future of the  ""Detective"" genre of games.

It draws heavily on real customs, countries, languages and even racial stereotypes but wraps it all up in new names and places. In most cases, this creates the pleasant strangeness of an uncertain fantasy world. Occasionally, however, the flood of unknown nations, names and ideas in never-ending dialogues can be quite exhausting. And while we're at it: There is a lot of talking. I mean a loooooot of talking. So if you're mainly looking for action, you're definitely in the wrong place. With The Final Cut version, however, the game now also has a superb voiceover, so we no longer have to read pages and pages of dialogue. The dubbing is one of the best I have ever heard in a video game. Especially the inner voice of our protagonist alone would be award-winning in my opinion. But in general, all the voice actors and actresses do an excellent job of portraying the incredibly diverse and varied cast. From the grumpy barman to the sly chairman, old truck driver lady or a bratty child. Listening to them is usually fun, even if the content sometimes varies. There were times when I thought to myself ""Come on, get on with it"" and read faster than the character spoke in order to click next. Compared to the game as a whole, however, this was a rarity. The dialogues, like the voice acting, are of an incredibly good quality. It's just a pity that the dialogue tree has a small shortcoming, namely that higher-level selections remain ""greyed out"" even though a new option underneath has been unlocked through new discoveries. But what is Disco Elysium actually about? We are a party animal of a detective who should be investigating a murder but has lost his memory. A role-playing game couldn't start in a more clichéd way. But the development of this party animal draws you in so much, makes you feel excited, make supposedly good decisions, make ""Now more than ever!"" decisions and want to know more and more about who we actually were, are and could become. And the run-down town of Revachol doesn't make it easy. Fortunately, we get the sympathetic detective Kim Kitsuragi from another Precinct to help us with advice and support. In my opinion, the chemistry between these two alone makes the game worth playing. The gameplay consists mainly of dialogues, gathering information for further dialogues and... Dice rolls. And oh boy... I got strong X-Com flashbacks here. Because at least in my playthrough, I completely messed up a lot of >70 rolls. Fortunately, there don't seem to be any soft locks in Disco Elysium and even if a failed dice roll hurts for a moment, it still advances the story. And that's exactly what makes the game so charming because we do our best and live with the consequences. Here I would strongly advise you not to save scum because that defeats the purpose of the game. And this theme of ""it is what it is"" runs through the whole game with its depressive undertone. We chat our way through the districts of Revachol (with a semi-successful fast-travelling system that forces us to go to one of three points before jumping to another), learn more about the world, the murder, the parties in the city and ourselves level up our skills and listen to the fantastic soundtrack. Which is also great and emphasises the game with its melancholic and sombre tones (except for that damn tent in which I couldn't hear myself think!). I can only advise you not to get too attached to the murder case. Because this is basically just the hook for the game. I made the mistake of finding the end of the game very disappointing.

I literally went from looking at the trailers and previews and saying ""I'm not sure if it's for me"" to ""there's almost no one I wouldn't recommend this to"" after playing about half the story.

It just excels so well in everything it's trying to do. The tragicomical narrative is amazing and the simple TTRPG resolution mechanic just keeps it moving seamlessly. Whenever you feel like you've hit a wall there are always ways to go around it and every interaction - be it part of the main mystery or just a random dialogue - entertains you and gives you more resources to progress in other parts of the game. Its ""fail-forward"" narrative design is so elegant that I think it communicates better how a TTRPG feels than the more traditional TTRPG-inspired games such as Divinity and Baldur's Gate, since your huge array of unconventional stats and skills makes it so solving problems never goes the way you were expecting.

The characters are extremely charismatic, the world-building is a brilliant mixture of realism and absurdity, the investigation is thrilling and unpredictable and it's all tied together by an amazing visual design and the impeccable voice acting.

For the precisely no one who is unfamiliar with Disco Elysium, yet still reading my reviews for some reason, Disco Elysium is a detective RPG. You play as Harry Dubois, an amnesiac detective tasked with solving the murder of a mysterious hanged man. He is joined by his partner, Kim Kitsuragi, as he investigates the murder, rediscovers himself, and reshapes the future of the district of Martinaise. 

Disco Elysium is a non-violent (mostly) RPG, creating a fairly distinct style of gameplay. Rather than investing in combat skills or weapons, players invest in ways for Harry to approach the world and the thoughts he has about it. A player might choose to invest heavily in empathy at the expense of logic, or in pounding athleticism rather than perception. The choice, as the game's tagline suggests, is entirely what sort of cop the player wants to be, and how they choose to interact with the world around them.

Disco Elysium is also almost entirely text-based. While Harry does move around a beautiful landscape, the problems he faces and barriers he must overcome are text-based, using a set of invisible dice to resolve whether he has the skill to overcome a particular challenge. His interactions with the world are based on the conversations he has and what he says, with the player's choices informing who he ultimately becomes. 

There's a lot within Disco Elysium that makes it clear why it's held in such high esteem. Its writing is some of the best writing in video games, with fleshed-out character after fleshed-out character filling Harry's world. Kim Kitsuragi alone is one of the best companions in the grand canon of video games, and he is one of many, many characters in Revachol. The world is lush and lived-in, and the ideas interesting to engage with. The history of the world is as much a character as any of the people, and Harry's grappling with it and placing himself within it as compelling as any relationship he builds with other people. 

Similarly, the very feeling of playing the game is phenomenal. Both its artistic style and music do an incredible job of building the world and its emotion. The plaintive horns of British Sea Power hit me every single time I entered the square outside the Whirling-in-Rags, and I kept being delighted by it. 

The sum of Disco Elysium's parts work together beautifully to create a masterful experience. The whole is greater than that sum, but even then, it's with the knowledge that each individual part is itself a masterpiece.

The puzzle with Disco Elysium, then, is more of a meta one. This is a game with universal acclaim, that everyone agrees is a modern classic. And yet, despite that acclaim and despite the real desire on the part of the game-buying public for more Disco Elysium, ZA/UM has not produced another game. There is no true sequel to Disco Elysium. Indeed, ZA/UM itself has splintered, with the devs and writers responsible for Disco Elysium scattering out to a variety of new studios and a variety of new projects. Much of this splintering is specifically because of the success of Disco Elysium. 

In many ways, the story of ZA/UM reflects the story of Harry Dubois. They were good at what they did, and they fell apart because of it. Also there were probably blonde ladies smelling of apricots involved, but I can't confirm that part. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3378374198

This is not to say that there are no successors to Disco Elysium, or that it hasn't had a lasting impact. Instead, it's fair to say that what made Disco Elysium so successful is also what makes it hard to reproduce, and arguably means its greater impact on games will be minimal, even while it remains one of the greatest games of all time. 

There are successors to Disco Elysium, games that likely owe their existence to the ground Disco Elysium broke. Games like Citizen Sleeper are very much games in the same vein as Disco Elysium, with a rich world explored through text, and a layered, living backstory that needs to be understood for the story to make sense. However much I love these games, though, they don't have a large impact on the industry. Instead, they remain indie darlings and cult favourites, games that everyone who plays them agrees are amazing, but whose success is based on criteria that don't appeal to a more general audience. 

Disco Elysium has a long tail, but it is a shallow one, lapping up against games that might never have otherwise succeeded, but drenching them when it does find them. 

This is the conversation that still remains about Disco Elysium. It's this conversation about its legacy, why it's complex, and why it's shallow. It's that conversation about what it takes to move the needle in an industry consolidating around the most profitable ventures to the exclusion of games like this one, and how, even when a game like Disco Elysium is successful, it's almost an act of self-sabotage. 

Disco Elysium is an incredible game. I wish there were more like it, but equally, I understand why there aren't.

From the moment you step into the shoes of the amnesiac detective, you're immersed in a beautifully crafted world that feels both rich and incredibly detailed. The art style is unique and evocative, blending a hand-painted aesthetic with a gritty, urban atmosphere that perfectly complements the game's themes.

What truly sets Disco Elysium apart is its writing. The dialogue is sharp, insightful, and often darkly humorous, with choices that genuinely impact the story. Each character you encounter is multifaceted, bringing their own struggles and philosophies that enrich the experience. The game’s depth of choice allows for a myriad of playstyles, whether you lean into your character’s intellect, charisma, or physical prowess.

The skill system is revolutionary, allowing players to engage with their own inner thoughts in ways that feel both personal and profound. It’s not just about solving a crime; it’s a deep exploration of identity, morality, and human experience. The way the game tackles themes of politics, addiction, and existential dread is both bold and refreshing.

The soundtrack perfectly complements the atmosphere, enhancing the emotional weight of pivotal moments without overpowering the narrative. Each encounter and revelation feels earned, leaving you reflecting long after the credits roll.

In summary, Disco Elysium is a stunning achievement in storytelling and character development. It’s a game that invites you to think, feel, and reflect, making it a must-play for anyone who appreciates deep narrative experiences.

Disco Elysium is a game that  actually takes advantage of being an interactive medium, a trope sadly under utilised in the RPG genre of video game.

Taking damage from sitting in an uncomfortable chair, not ever being able to get my tie off the fan because I kept failing the check, founding a nightclub, being a communist, finding many racists and giving all of them shit for it, telling a rich lady she should kill herself (effectively) and the pinnacle of this game, the autistic mechanical engineering nerd Kim Kitsuragi. 

Additionally I'll swiftly praise the games amazing choice of how dialogue functions. Not only are you speaking with the characters parts of your personality which you actually invest attribute points into and gear affecting whether or not they'll show you behind the curtains during a conversation as well as allowing you to interact with these characters differently.

Disco Elysium is not a game, it's an experience. I have personally never played a game like it, but I'm happy I finally did. Have been hearing about Disco Elysium for so long, how big of a masterpiece it was, and how everyone should play it, and how it has 97 on Metacritic, and so on. It was 90% off a while back so I just picked it up. Great investment. Around 55 hours of playtime, beautiful story, memorible characters, and finally, a 'Choices Matter' game where your choices actually matter. I only have 1 'negative' thing to say about it, and to be honest it's not even that bad, it's just something that could get a bit annoying. This game has a lot of dialogue, and I mean A LOT, 95% of the game is just talking to people, which is not necessarily a bad thing, however, sometimes it feels like some dialogue is completely unnecessary.

No glitches, no problems whatsoever.

Ok onto the review of the game itself:

What an incredible game. Truly among the best video games I have ever played in my life… and completely unlike what I would personally enjoy, typically.

Genuinely the weirdest video game I have ever played in terms of tone and dialogue etc, but I mean that in a very positive way.

The level of choice in terms of what sort of person you want to be is sort unprecedented as far as I have ever seen.

The world building is up there with BG3 and TW3 as the best I have ever experienced in this medium.

It’s dreary, it’s gray, it’s SUPER depressing… but once you’re in you can’t pull yourself away. Not just because of the main story’s mystery, but also because you HAVE to see how things unfold for the protagonist PERSONALLY.

This game is not about graphic fidelity. It almost looks like older CRPG games; just a little smoothed out… but this isn’t the game to play if you’re looking for visuals… it’s a gritty RPG, choice-and-consequence, story-based game… and it’s among the best ever, at that.",1729442623,1729442623,True,10,0,0.5996542572975158,0,False,False,False,True,632470,20250114_132033,positive,100

My very first time hearing of Disco Elysium, like most people, was during The Game Award 2019, where it managed to win four awards -- Best Narrative, Best RPG, Fresh Indie Game, and Best Independent Game -- shocking the world in the process. I knew at that moment, I had to check it out. Eventually, five years and more than a handful of world-altering events later, I got around to it. Now hailed by many as quite possibly the best-written video game ever made, it's suffice to say that the game's reputation has only gotten more legendary since -- especially with the release of The Final Cut. With a word count surpassing even that of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the prospect of playing is an enormous undertaking that had me more than a little intimidated. But, as someone relatively new to the genre, I loved every second of it. A hardcore point-and-click narratively driven role-playing game through and through, Disco Elysium won me over with its sheer creativity, imagination, and raw storytelling prowess. Never before have I played a game such as this.

[h2] The Positives ▼ [/h2]

[b] 1. Exceptionally Written [/b]
Over the course of decades and hundreds of games, the ongoing list of what I'd consider to be the best-written games is constantly growing and changing. Titles such as Bioshock, Yakuza 0, Nier Automata, Persona 5, and Soma, to name a few, are kings of that list and have been for several years. Now, allow me to dethrone them all in one fell swoop of the pen. Ladies & gentlemen, there is now a new reigning monarch in the kingdom, and his majesty's name is Harry motherf#cking Du Bois. Clever, creative, highly imaginative, nuanced, mature, and funny as all hell, Disco Elysium set a new benchmark for writers across the industry for how to write compelling characters, conflicts, and dialogues. Frankly, it's an achievement for writing as a medium in general. Without a hint of hyperbole, Disco Elysium is the greatest written work I've seen in a video game, and I can't praise it enough.

[b] 2. Incredible Vocal Performances [/b]
The Final Cut brought a heap of additional content and improvements, one of which is fully voice acting. I cannot even begin to stress how phenomenal and life-changing this is for the game. Besides making it more digestible for readers of all skill levels, the vocal performances themselves are world-class. As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to say it's the best vocal performance I have ever seen in an indie title, surpassing even that of Hades. I tried to look up the actors - expecting to see the usual credits and faces, but to my surprise, it was nobody I knew. Just a bunch of relatively unknown actors and musicians with strong theatre backgrounds that I am only now hearing of for the first time. Genuinely, it's some of the best voice acting in any video game. 

[b] 3. Strong Emphasis On Player's Choice [/b]
Much like its other core endeavors, Disco Elysium is unrivaled when it comes to giving players agency, freedom, and choices. Want to take the beaten road and become a good cop? It's yours. How about becoming the most corrupt bastard in town? Done. Wanna become a raging communist? Go for it. There are myriads of different ways to tackle the murder case at the heart of the story. There's no such thing as the ""right"" path, and players are encouraged to role-play and experiment to their heart's content. And this isn't just some veneer thrown in for good measure, either. What you do and say will have real consequences for the characters and plots of Disco Elysium, and the world will change in accordance with your choices. As a result, Martainise feels like a living breathing district, and it's refreshing to see how reactive the writing is when pushed to its absolute limit. 

[b] 4. Failure Is Not The End [/b]
What I love the most about Disco Elysium's gameplay is that it is equally as rewarding and fun failing a skill check as much as it passing one. When I see a game implement these kinds of mechanics, it's often to the detriment of the players. Luck-based mechanics almost always lead to frustration and save scumming, but Disco Elysium found a way. By making it so that white checks are retriable so long as one invests a skill point into it and by making failing a check equally as hilarious, satisfying, and interesting as succeeding one, the game sorely feels cheap and unfair when you do inevitably fail. I adore this about Disco Elysium and found it to be one of the game's most innovative aspects. 

[b] 5. Great Soundtrack [/b]
When it's commonplace to spend upward of thirty minutes to an hour engaging in an average conversation, it's not just important to have a great soundtrack -- it's an existential imperative. Disco Elysium not only survived -- but thrived. As players, we can explore and see the poverty-stricken district of Martainise firsthand and read all about the political limbo of Revachol. But, to feel and understand it through the power of music, now that's powerful. The heart and soul of Disco Elysium wouldn't be the same without the beautiful music composed by Sea Power that made it so nostalgic and memorable. 

[b] 6. Excellent Art Style  [/b]
While not the most technically and graphically impressive game out there, what Disco Elysium does have is a unique and beautiful-looking oil painting art style that sets it apart from its contemporaries. Drawn by Aleksander Rostov, it's hard to overstate how crucial his unique art direction is for visually communicating the tone and feel of the game. Everything from the skill and character portraits to the environments and the surreal thought backgrounds -- the game has a certain indescribable feel to it that makes it so distinctive and beautiful to look at. 

[h2] The Negatives ▼ [/h2]

[b] 1. Technically Unpolished [/b]
No game is without fault, and in the case of Disco Elysium, that has to be for its lack of polish. For all of its incredible achievements, the game has a habit of feeling janky and unpolished more often than I would've liked. Technical bugs, voice lines not matching with what's written on the screen, poor animation, mechanics not working consistently like fast traveling, and more. And if you're truly unlucky, some bugs can even be game-breaking. As much as I love the game, this list of technical issues is impossible to ignore and frankly -- unacceptable. 

[b] 2. No Sorting System? [/b]
One of the core gameplay loops of Disco Elysium is collecting articles of clothing that, when equipped, can raise particular stats rendering skill checks easier to pass. By the end of the game, it's not uncommon for the average player to amass anywhere from a few to a couple of dozen, and going through all of them every time you want to increase a stat is a pain. Why is there not a simple sorting system that allows players to choose a stat they're looking for and filter out the rest? Having this kind of system would've greatly reduced time players spend in the inventory equipping gears. I can't believe such a simple and obvious solution somehow got overlooked. 

[h3] Final Thoughts [/h3]
The success of Disco Elysium lies in its focus. The writers and designers had a strong vision for the kind of game that they were trying to make and the audience that would play it. No compromise, no surrendering. Five years later, the result continues to speak for itself. Celebrated by fans worldwide for its narrative brilliance and as a generation and genre-defining game, Disco Elysium continues to be a game that fans and developers point to as a glowing beacon in the industry. A standard for all to aspire to and, most importantly, dare to surpass. It's been one hell of a ride, but all good things must come to an end.

It's not your typical RPG, and it's unlike anything I've played before. If you're looking for a traditional action game, this might not be for you. But if you’re open to something different something more focused on story and choice then this game is worth your time.

 What I like about DE is that there are no “right” answers, you’re allowed to be as idealistic or as cynical as you want. The game really lets you shape your character’s personality through your choices, and the dialogue reflects that. It’s a lot more about conversation and internal conflict than about solving puzzles or fighting enemies. You really feel immersed and often times you feel like you're a real somewhat f-ed up Detective.

I ended up losing my computer (currently writing this on mobile) and was incredibly disappointed that I was not able to get back into the game after my interest in it piqued again- all until very recently as it was released on the Nintendo Switch. 

Now, after about 20-ish hours playing the game on the switch, I’m absolutely enamored. The music is gorgeous, a cacophony of horns and twangy rhythmic guitar, droning synth, high tempo disco music, etc. I highly reccomend listening to it, even if it’s just in the background. 

The art is beautiful, the portraits able to capture the unique faces and personalities of all the amazing citizens of Revachol that you meet, as well as the hauntingly captivating portraits of your skills (clearly, I really like half-lights portrait) that can convey so much emotion. The background are meticulously designed and capture the perfect eerie feeling of walking through this recovering post-war city. It’s like walking through an acrylic or oil pastel artwork.

As for the FULLY VOICE ACTED CAST, Lenval Brown absolutely nails his roles as the skills and your inner thoughts, the overall narrator of everything that happens. It’s really like listening to how my brain talks to itself, arguing and making decisions, like it took a peek inside my head. Anyways, not just Brown, but also every single other side character, has amazing voice work. They all feel like real, tangible people.

Where this amazing game really shines is the writing. It’s said that there are 1.2 million words in the game, which is literally longer than the entire LOTR trilogy. (In fact, it’s more than twice as large, as the LOTR trilogy is only a measly 480,000 words!)
With that, I’m not gonna sugarcoat it, Disco Elysium is honestly like reading a really long book (and that may be obvious to some), but it’s a book you cannot put down. The lore and world building of the entire town is so well thought out, it almost feels like reading genuine history. There’s so many little lore bits about the city and world that I’m sure a large amount of players will miss their first time through. 
The writing for the interactions with NPCs and Kim are so natural, so fluid and realistic it’s almost like watching a genuine conversation, or even having one. You can see all the minute details of a person you’re talking to, you can draw conclusions from the composure or even see into their souls with empathy- All of these are small things we subconsciously do in real life, and Disco Elysium nails how it feels. Just, mwah. Amazing writing my god.

Finally, I’m not quite fully in on the scoop of what’s happened with ZA/UM; I’ve only purchased the switch version about a week ago and haven’t kept up online, but from my rough and limited understanding, the original creators *are not even being payed for this absolute masterpiece.* It’s a fucking travesty against art and almost cruelly ironic given some of the anti-capital sentiments discussed in game.

Overall, a 10/10 game, a genuinely life changing experience to play, yet- don’t buy it here. Don’t give this shitty corpo your money. Go pirate this game on your own. And go check out what the RIGHTFUL CREATORS are doing, and maybe even find a way to support them.

That is all. Have a wonderful day, whoever you might be.

In the hopes of catching one of my friends looking at this game tentatively over the upcoming Steam Sales, here goes...

This is the best narrative-driven CRPG in the last 25 years.

The writing feels so alive, every word of it. The art is evocative, as if Hieronymus Bosch reincarnated and painted a triptych depicting our modern broken world. The soundtrack by British Sea Power fits the game perfectly. The story and characters pull you in right away. The combined vibes are just off the charts. This is a real work of art.

The game gives you tools to shape your character with a one-of-a-kind skill system. In addition to typical skill checks it provides additional internal dialogue interjections and options. Thought Cabinet gives you further bonuses and maluses as you choose what kind of thoughts to internalize. These systems are mechanically perfect for this style of game. As in any good RPG, you roll a lot of dice. The failed rolls are often funnier than the successful ones. If you can't accept the outcome, most of the rolls can be retried later. Trying again fits the theme of the game perfectly. There are tons of hidden modifiers unlocked by exploring the world and engaging with the game. The game consistently rewards exploration and engaging with it.

The game lives and dies by its script. Over one million words, now fully voice-acted in The Final Cut, with delightful acting  throughout. The game doesn't hesitate to be real -- it isn't at all afraid of confronting and calling out the player. Some of the topics it deals with are incredibly heavy, and not often encountered in games. There is a lot of black humor weaved in. It's [b]very[/b] Estonian in character, something I bonded with right away as a Finn. The failures of communism, socialism, capitalism, fascism and centrism are all explored here in depth. The game gets crushingly sad at times, yet nonetheless it is permeated with a sense of vague hope. It can be a journey of healing.

The [i]only[/i] reason to skip this game is if you're not a reader or suffer from attention span issues. The full voice acting only helps up to a point. It demands attention and rewards patience.

The only relevant point of comparison is to Planescape: Torment, an obscure CRPG from 1999 that was previously my uncontested favorite CRPG of all time. It is a similarly word-heavy story, with a similarly amnesiac main character, but if we are being real, Planescape suffers from its Dungeons & Dragons engine and combat. The setting is completely different and the story being told hits completely different beats. Clearly Planescape: Torment served as a faint inspiration, but the comparisons don't do Disco Elysium justice.

I'm frankly surprised that five years after release, this style and the mechanics haven't been copied by other games. Perhaps that is for the best. This is a unique masterpiece, and unluckily for us the studio that made it has disintegrated since, in a very Disco Elysium fashion.

It slowly grew on me the more I kept going, and while playing it I felt totally immersed in its world.

Disco Elysium was on my backlog for a while, I had heard great things about it and so I finally picked it up and pushed through it. Well, actually “pushing through” is probably non the appropriate terminology since it took me a long time to complete and I don't have much spare time lately to split between my many hobbies. I should just say I savored it, piece by piece, and it actually tasted great!

I should say the incipit is a bit of a cliche, probably overused in too many games, but it works well here. The game starts with an amnesiac character (us) and we will have to backtrack and piece together what happened up until that point, before alcohol and drugs abuse caused us to trash our room and forget everything. 

We will soon find out we are detectives, tasked to solve a murder case in Martinaise, one of the poorest and degraded areas of the city of Revachol, a former capital of the world now in decay.

Alongside us we will have the trustworthy lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, in my opinion one of the best characters ever conceived in videogames history. In fact, all characters in this game are extremely well written and really feel human more than NPCs. The fact the entirety of the dialogues are dubbed is an even more surprising fact, given how many lines of dialogue there are overall. Aside from other characters, we will often have thoughts, represented through internal dialogues with different parts of our psyche and personality. As I said before, the quality and depth of the writing is paramount and it really is the key factor which kept me immersed in the story.

The overall atmosphere is great too, the semi open world hub areas aren't really big, but they are densely packed with things and characters to interact with, and almost everything opens up new branches of the story, side quests which are often linked to the main one or simply just help getting a better grasp at the world we are into, both socially, politically and economically. 

I was baffled at how the overall experience was tightly tied together, and how seemingly random things ended up connecting later on and forming such a cohesive world feeling. Every piece of the puzzle nicely fits together in the end. 

The story is also great, it's a detective noir rich with plot twists, as it should be. Alongside it, we will be choosing which kind of cop we want to be, through ethical and moral choices we’re presented with.
I won't spoil anything, but nothing is what it seems and no stone deserves to be left unturned.

Talking about graphics, Disco Elysium has a very peculiar hand drawn style, which is timeless and will help appreciate the game even many years from now. There are lots and lots of fine details which convey a feeling of decay from the world aesthetics. Every character and even each personality trait has its own hand drawn portrait. I truly appreciated the effort in this regard.

The sound in this game is absolutely brilliant. As I said before, all the countless dialogues are completely dubbed, and trust me when I say there are lots and lots of lines. And the voice actors are really good too, “S” tier dare I say.
Aside from the stellar voice acting, the soundtrack is great as well. Every hub has a main theme, but music dynamically adapts to the events, in order to properly convey all the emotions and feelings of the moment.

Playing Disco Elysium is basically like reading a dynamic book. Writing is brilliant, and dialogues often go really deep into many different topics, ranging from more serious socio-economic and political subjects to lore, religion, science, and much more. This really succeeds at making the fictional world really believable and immersive.

The only real complaint I have towards this game is that some dialogue trees are really massive and it's not possible to save during these. Some dialogues can easily last the better part of an hour, thus the ability to save midway would have been really appreciated. It also would have made it easier to save scum dice rolls, but you can do that anyways, it's just more inconvenient.

All in all I'm really happy I finally completed Disco Elysium, I would recommend it to anyone who loves RPGs and great writing in general. I also found the english translation of the book this game was inspired from, and I will for sure give it a read eventually.

The game sets an incredible standard for storytelling in video games. The script is easily one of the best I’ve ever encountered, full of sharp wit, emotional depth, and meaningful dialogue. Every conversation is a masterclass in writing, and the world-building feels both intricate and alive.

The voice acting is phenomenal—each character is brought to life with performances that perfectly match their personalities, adding even more weight to the already incredible writing. While there were a few moments where the audio dialogue didn’t match the text, this was a minor issue and didn’t detract from my overall immersion.

Visually, the game is stunning. The hand-painted art style is both unique and beautiful, capturing the bleak and mysterious atmosphere of the setting in a way that feels fresh and memorable. The music is equally impressive, with an atmospheric score that perfectly complements every moment, whether it’s quiet introspection or a dramatic turning point.

That said, there are a few aspects that may not be for everyone. It can take a few hours to really click, as the game’s systems and narrative style aren’t immediately conventional. The lack of combat may also turn some players off, but for me, it was refreshing to see a game focus so deeply on dialogue, choices, and character development instead.

Additionally, the setting is quite bleak. This isn’t a feel-good game, in my opinion—it’s heavy, introspective, and at times uncomfortably real. If you’re looking for something lighthearted, this might not be the best fit.

The idea of disintegrated ego that's trying to recollect itself through body, mind, ideology is so powerful. How they made it not boring and interesting is ingenious. Playing that game was sometimes very deep, transcendential expirience, that i somehow feel that i will never expirience from any other game. 

It was a great litarature and narrative expirience. I've never thought that any game could quote and develop the ideas of Hegel, Zizek, Fisher and others. What I'm surprised about is how lots of people love it. In the times, where people could not concentrate more then 15 seconds on anything, they made a game where you read all the time and it is not that easy reading. 

 The main character, Harry, he represents many of us. He is good, intellegenent, descent man, who just can not handle this world, like so many of us. Such a deep glance on depression in contemporary society and all destructive practices that come as a result. (Harry was so lucky to meet exactly Kitsuragi as his partner. This parental figure, who otherwise do not treat him like a child, but shows him, that he is a person with his own capabilities, strenghth and weaknesess). 

The ending was very Lacanian for me. They showed a man who lived all his live in his fantasies not even guessing that he is in the phantasm of his. If i ever want to work on something in my life it would be the game like this. The game like this perhaps is not possible in any time soon. Thank you.

Somehow, the dramatic and depressive mood of the world of Revachol has spread to the ZA/UM studios. Despite the fact that Disco Elysium is one of the highest-rated games in the entire history of games, ZA/UM went through such a series of scandals, problems, and dismissals of key employees that we can’t even hope for a continuation of the game anytime soon.

Visual 10/10

There are no vivid visual effects, but the style and art are very deep and interesting. Many companies try to earn marketing points by not using AI instead of real artists’ concepts. However, usually, these human-made arts are dull. Disco Elysium’s art is the rare case where artists have really done great work. The genre is poorly visualized but still, the environment conveys the depressive and melancholic mood of the world; the portraits of the characters are made in different styles and highlight their personal traits. My favorite art in the game are the pictures of the skills. They are absolutely amazing, and I've seen many people on various parts of the internet use these images as avatars, including myself.

Narrative 10/10

The plot is not overloaded with delusional elements like parallel universes, but there are still plenty of crazy and interesting things at the junction of reality and madness, which give you space to interpret and guess what is happening. The basic story is solid and interesting, developing alongside the game as are the character arcs. One of the best indicators of the high caliber of the game's characters is the fact that there are plenty of groups on Telegram, Facebook, and other social networks where people create and share memes and fan fiction about the game's characters. But the main gem of the game is a bunch of philosophical, social, political, and historical questions, which the authors explore through dialogues between the player and the characters. In some ways, this is not only a game but also a socio-political and philosophical treatise and discussion at the same time. And precisely this aspect makes the game so amazing and unique.

Gameplay 10/10

I’ve seen plenty of discussions about the gameplay in Disco Elysium: some people assume there is hardly any gameplay at all, and it’s more an interactive book than a game. But look – it’s not just a big text that you read. Instead, the entire dialogue tree depends on your character traits and personality. I’ve played twice, and each time I created completely different characters, resulting in all the dialogues being different. This is a main feature of the game: the role-playing aspect is truly inimitable here. You can find something like this in very old-school RPGs like Fallout 1 and 2, but there are very few such games, literally a few. And Disco Elysium is probably the best among them.

Sound 10/10

It might seem odd, but yes, even the sound is magnificent and flawless here. Musical tracks from the game have become legendary, and you'll understand why if you have played. The voice actors have done truly amazing work; I haven't seen better voice acting anywhere else. I’ve heard that the development team did not plan to voice all the dialogues in the game since the whole game consists of them and there are tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of text. But in the end, they voiced 100% of the text in the game, and I am sure that the voice acting has become one of the ingredients of the wonderful cocktail that is Disco Elysium.

Overall 10/10

I hope I have explained why you should try this game if you enjoy role-playing gameplay, an interesting plot, distinctive arts, and good music. I am really happy for you if you have not played this game yet. But I am also happy for myself and everyone else who has played it, because, first of all, we gained an amazing game experience over dozens of hours and, secondly, we still have the opportunity to return to the game, create a new style of character, and play the game from almost scratch.

First of all approach the game with a very open mind as it touches many subjects that are sensitive to some, including and not limited to politics, if you have any kind of strong views towards something chances are those views might get insulted in the game eventually or questioned at the least.

Though, I hear Tides of Numenera is also worth a run, for some of that same experience. But that's where Disco Elysium excels, in that it also manages to distinguish itself sufficiently.

What Disco Elysium is, is a great murder-mystery and very thorough detective story, surrounded by slight political satire and critique, touching on everything from ultra capitalism, racialism, neo-liberalism to socialism and communism. While also managing to expose the player to some very thoughtful, mature and heartfelt stories involving just regular people and the drama of the human condition.

It ranges and very easily shifts from absolute heart-wrenching stories, to grim and depressing, to the most wacky and out-there experiences that almost feel like the writers were on acid. At least that's what I'd imagine being on acid is like.

The amount of physical and mental skills used in the game, and because of that the amount of skill checks for various context and information, is astounding and really encourages experimentation and replays. Though, one area that I really did not dabble in very much is the cabinet of thoughts. It looked cool in theory, and I love the flavor text, but it forcing me to choose between skills and thoughts kind of made it too complicated. So I just stuck to min-maxing the main skills. Maybe on a replay.

The music is also wonderful, as is the pastel art style.

About the only negative I could find was the voice actor of one character, Ruby, that for some reason was very monotone and really stuck out like a sore thumb. And the very final 1-2h of play feel very railroaded. But even so I enjoyed the ending and the explanation of what started the whole story. Very mature and subdued.

It is truly a one-of-a-kind experience, and sadly after almost 5 years have passed since its initial release, it seems even more mythic and unrepeatable now. The creatives behind it delivered a narrative experience that is frankly unparalleled with anything I’ve ever played. From the mesmerizingly melancholic world of Elysium to its riveting plot and conflict informed by the detailed politics and history of Revachol. This being conveyed naturally through tidbits you learn from its inhabitants and the environment as you explore it. Every character you meet along the way feels as though they really live and breathe, existing separately from the player’s interaction, they communicate their own views and temperaments in a way that is astonishingly lifelike and individual. This is bolstered by the diverse array of voice talent, each of which sound exactly how they read, perfectly understanding the nuance and tone of the script. A particular highlight for me was the presence of Kim Kitsuragi, he feels like a real companion throughout, having him by you side at all times facilitates intricacy in your interaction with the environment and other characters which otherwise wouldn’t be possible. The way he voices his interpretation of the investigation as it progresses, interjecting in interviews, pulling you aside to talk over things in private, scolding you when you act up; it lends so much legitimacy to the role of the detective you are playing as well as the experience overall. To sum it up Disco Elysium’s writing is vivid, wry, authentic, and truly singular.

The genius of Disco Elysium’s design lies in its decision to abandon conventional gameplay, so that it can tell a story completely unconstrained, while importantly maintaining a traversable, interactable, and compelling world to explore and immerse yourself in. I’m really hopeful we will see future games adopt this approach as it will allow for new and more sophisticated stories to be told, furthering games as a narrative medium. The gameplay in Disco Elysium is essentially there to reinforce the story, there is no twitchy real time combat to keep you hooked, purely exploration, interfacing with the environment and others and roleplaying in the form of decision making, equipment and stat distribution. For example, the commitment to make certain choices partly up to chance in the form of white and red checks, is exciting, adding tension and gravity to key moments. This in combination with the skill system determining Harry’s abilities and thoughts makes each playthrough feel unique and I’m eager to see what changes on a replay using a different archetype.

But holy shit, when this game clicked, it *clicked* hard. Hardcore. Hardcore to the mega. 

The way that the game interacts with itself, with every choice you actively make (dialogue, walking around and picking stuff up, investigating it, etc) iterating on itself to further influence that specific playthrough. Not to mention the passive ability checks, and how they're always more than they seem. 

But the game also iterates with the opposite: the options you *don't* choose, the checks you actively and passively fail - with the end result being an experience that you'll find hard to replicate.

The game is incredible. The art is incredible. The story is like nothing I've ever quite come across: utterly compelling, terrifying but kind, despairing but hopeful. It's exceptional.

However, after all this, should you buy it? No.

I won't go into excruciating specifics on the horror show legal drama surrounding ZA/UM and the writers/creators of the world of Disco Elysium but in short, the studio was bought out by the producers/shareholders (using very sketchy sources of financing, look into it) , the creators and original project team bullied and harassed out of the company and away from the world they'd spent over a decade building. 

Those thieves who wear the skin of creativity, touting accomplishments that don't belong to them and enjoying rewards that they didn't earn do not deserve your time or your money. 

But while you shouldn't buy it, you should still play it. Nay, you need to play it. 
Though, I'll leave it up to you to find ways of playing without paying, as it were ;)

The fact that the game brought the medieval fantasy trope so vibrantly to life, paired with the fact that the game was so long, made me enjoy it for several years after that, and also because it was so moddable.

5 years later, this giant of a game got its sequel: S K Y R I M.

Hoo boy, the internet was abuzz for months after release, from arrow in the knee jokes to how life-ruiningly fun the game was, but when I first saw Skyrim's trailer I was a bit underwhelmed - the graphics, while definitely a big improvement over Oblivion, still didn’t look THAT much better. 2011 was already an age when games like Crysis 2, Killzone 2, Metro 2033, Battlefield 3 and the like were out. Thus, the long awaited Skyrim in its hues of grey somewhat disappointed me and I didn’t get it on day 1. Instead, I chose to wait for the Legendary Edition that included all 3 DLCs: Hearthfire, Dragonborn & Dawnguard.

When I finally started playing Skyrim I noticed that Bethesda had made a huge number of improvements (also with the experience from Fallout 3 & NV). Many of these inspired by popular mods for previously released Bethesda games. For example, the fact that NPCs now carry torches in the dark was something that wasn’t so in Oblivion, but the content of a very popular mod. Or Dungeons no longer having a silly door that you need to open to get in or out. You can place your books on bookshelves, towns are illuminated at night, you can hear your heart pounding when low on health and on top of all this, there is horse combat now!

Things like cooking, forging, smelting, tanning and sharpening have also been introduced - all you need is ore that can be smelted into ingots, which in turn are needed to create armor. Buying ingots and crafting your armor yourself is cheaper than buying it directly from the blacksmith. Of course, different armors need different types of ingots, like moonstone for Elvish & orichalcum for Orcish. Weapons & armor no longer degrade after fighting, and repair hammers are thus non-existent in Skyrim.

Magic underwent a HUGE improvement. You can now cast spells with your left hand or your right, or even simultaneously. Destruction battlemage? Grab your sword in your right hand and cast spells with your left as you charge in for the kill. Restoration battlemage? Strike blows with your right while you have your left hand ready to heal yourself. Defensive warlock? Grab your shield with your left hand to ward off enemies who get too close, while hurling spells with your right. Full-on spell caster? Hurl a torrent of spells at your enemy using both hands! Obviously your mana should be appropriately large for this kind of warfare. The fact that staffs are now one-handed instead of two is even more of a bonus for wizards as this allows them to cast spells using their mana while simultaneously casting spells from their staff that does not tap into their mana but uses up magical charge instead. And the utterly useless ""touch"" school of magic has been removed and the ""on target"" school of magic has been changed in that instead of hurling one spell after another at the foe, you now launch a steady stream of magic at them. There are also some pretty new improvements like the illumination spell now in the form of a glowing ball of light that floats above your head or sticks to any surface you hurl it at. Impressive!

But what I strongly dislike about Skyrim are its random enemy encounters. Bears & sabre cats jump at you from behind a pile of rocks, and it doesn’t take much playing to realize this wasn’t a nice effect of the immersive game world taking you by surprise, no, this was literally an enemy materializing out of thin air when your character gets into its scripted trigger zone. This is fun once or twice, but being unable to ride your horse for 5 minutes in one direction without being ambushed by such a creature spawn is just ANNOYING! At least in previous Bethesda games you could see enemies already existing in the game world (and thus avoid them) instead of them being created on the spot.

Now Skyrim is a cold place, but Bethesda has made sure that the game world isn’t as monotonous as a Cyrodiil player new to Skyrim might think - you'll still find plenty of green forests and almost Cyrodilic pastures in Skyrim (e.g. around Falkreath or Riften), while the hold stays true to its icy hallmark the further north you go - from the cold craglands of the Reach over the frozen coast of northern Skyrim to the volcanic lands of Eastmarch reminiscent of Yellowstone, there is variety. It gets even better when it comes to dungeons - the mainstay of every RPG. In Oblivion each dungeon had a different layout, but the majority of them were generic (mine, cave, ayleid ruin & fort). In Skyrim on the other hand, while dungeons can indeed be divided into these same 4 types (though it's nord crypt instead of ayleid ruin), each dungeon feels like it was hand crafted to have its own unique and distinctive charm - each has its own story to tell and it feels like its own mini-adventure when you embark on clearing out a dungeon in Skyrim. While there are several that are duds (just a large room inhabited by two bears you're done clearing within a minute), the Dwemer Ruins are nothing short of fantastic that sometimes need more than an hour to clear as you keep working your way ever downward and marvel at the great cities of the dwarves now inhabited by foul goblinlike Falmer - I've had more than one breathtaking Moria moment while doing these ruins!

While Cyrodiil had 9 distinct cities (one of which was destroyed), Skyrim only has 5 cities of such size. The other 4 are merely glorified villages, and even the largest city cant match the amount of hours you spent in the Imperial City. Perhaps to make up for this, Skyrim has gone overboard with quests. While Oblivion had 174 quests, Skyrim has 273. While a great deal of them are fetch-quests, i.e. an NPC asks you to retrieve an item for them from a ruin and bring it back for a reward - which can get tedious after a while (and these also get dumped in a new ""Miscellaneous"" section in your quest log) there still are enough themed and characterful quests to easily give Oblivion a run for its money.

And unlike the Fallout games (or even Oblivion) Skyrim's quests not only take you to almost every possible corner of the map, but also encourage a style of play where you can spend the first 100 hours without even bothering with the main quest. There's that much stuff to do - you never get bored. I can't speak of this kind of satisfying main-quest-avoidal in any previous Bethesda game, not even Oblivion.

Something I really love is the world map - it's no longer a piece of parchment, but an actual, interactive bird's eye view over 3D terrain, including weather effects like clouds and volumetric fog. The latter also tend to wrap around mountain peaks as well, making things look that much more realistic. While Skyrim may be a bit smaller than Cyrodiil, everything feels more natural - Cyrodiil felt like a game world, where dungeons were evenly spaced out and felt like they were deliberately placed there, instead of being hewn into the landmass and thus part of its physical geography. In Skyrim you dont need fancy mods like Oblivion's Unique Landscapes to find yourself navigating between beautiful rivers, rocks, forests and ravines. Everything feels like it has been shaped by the raw forces of nature rather than dragged and dropped in a game editor. 

No previous TES title had its gameworld as beautifully designed.

But did we listen? No. We were too busy chasing butterflies, adopting children, and somehow ending up the leader of every guild in Tamriel. Seriously, how does the Companions trust you after you ""accidentally"" decapitated half of Whiterun?

The graphics? Stunning in 2011, still passable in 2024—especially with mods. Oh, the mods. Want to fight Thomas the Tank Engine instead of dragons? Done. Want Macho Man Randy Savage yelling at you from the sky? Also done. Skyrim is less a game and more a platform for chaos. The limit isn’t your imagination; it’s your PC’s ability to run with 400 mods installed.

And then there’s the bugs. Glorious, beautiful bugs. Floating horses, NPCs walking through walls, and your follower getting stuck in a door for the 50th time—it’s all part of the charm. Bethesda didn’t create a flawless masterpiece; they created a sandbox where even the glitches are entertaining.

The soundtrack? Perfection. You’ll be humming the Dragonborn Theme while getting wrecked by a frost troll on the way to High Hrothgar. It’s a rite of passage. The voice acting? Well, let’s just say the same five voice actors are really working overtime. But hey, you’ll never forget lines like “I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee.” Iconic.

Skyrim is less about the story (because let’s be honest, who even remembers the main quest?) and more about the experience. It’s a game where you can spend hours picking flowers, crafting iron daggers, and wondering why every guard knows you’re carrying stolen goods. It’s a game where you can literally shout a dragon off a mountain and call it ""strategy.""

So, should you play Skyrim? Absolutely. It’s a timeless classic that lets you be whoever you want—except someone who actually finishes the main story. Whether you’re a stealth archer (let’s be real, we’re all stealth archers) or a dual-wielding lunatic, Skyrim welcomes you. Just don’t forget to save often—because that frost troll isn’t going to wait. 10/10, would Fus Ro Dah a goat off a cliff again.",1734109139,1734109139,True,26,8,0.7270660996437072,0,False,False,False,False,72850,20250114_132020,positive,100

I know the Legendary Edition is unlisted. But if you somehow still manage to grab it and and want to mod, be prepared for hours of tinkering and headaches. List of the technical problems that I've faced while modding:

+ There is an unlisted DLC on Steam store for HD textures patch -> I needed it for another bug fix mod to work.

+ No borderless/windowed fullscreen mode -> Had to changed the .ini file setting. And yet it's still a bit janky when Alt-Tabbing to something else.

+ Running game over 60fps and high refresh rate will cause weird water splashing sound when walking or running -> Had to adjust the fps limit of my monitor.

+ Skyrim HD - 2k Textures mod will cause crash at the start of the game or infinite loading screen (happened to me at Whiterun gate). This is due to something related to original Skyrim being only x32 bit and runs on low VRAM (iirc) -> Needed to change it with ENB. Very time consuming just to look up the solution.

+ Can't turn off strong head bob / screen shake when sprinting in both perspectives, causing motion sickness -> I found a mod for it and it only worked for 1 session. I haven't tried to fix it.

+ This is more on the mod itself but Skyrim Unbound (Alternate Start) mod may lock you out of the main questline if you don't choose to be the Dragonborn at the start.


Just some notable problems that I still remember. Tbf I used the Skyrim Ultimate Immersion collection (100+ mods) on Nexus so a lot of time was spent checking what worked and what not. My game still occasionally crashed after every ~3hrs of gameplay but it was nothing serious and I'm too lazy to check crash log.

From the moment you step out of Helgen, your journey as the Dragonborn is a foot-fueled adventure that will have you thinking about every step you take across this vast, immersive world.

Let's start with the character creation. Sure, you can adjust your character's race, facial features, and even give them a cool scar, but the real magic happens when you scroll down to the feet. Sadly, you can't customize them, but once you slip on your first pair of boots—or go barefoot if you're feeling particularly wild—you'll realize just how important those feet are for your travels.

The true beauty of Skyrim's feet-centric gameplay is in its movement. Every town, dungeon, and mountain you explore is a testament to your character's feet. Feel the crunch of snow underfoot as you climb the Throat of the World, or the satisfying thud of leather soles on the cobblestones of Whiterun. And let’s not forget the barefoot option—there’s something deeply satisfying about dismissing armor and wandering the wilds of Skyrim with nothing between your toes and the cold, hard ground.

Combat also brings the feet into focus. Whether you’re sneaking up on a bandit with cat-like silence or sprinting away from a fire-breathing dragon, your feet are the unsung heroes of every battle. The sound of your footsteps can alert enemies, while a swift kick (well, in your imagination) can be the final blow that takes down a foe.

And for those who truly want to embrace the foot life, mods have got you covered. Want to go completely barefoot through the frozen tundra? There’s a mod for that. How about adding more detailed foot textures so you can really appreciate those toes? Mods have your back, or rather, your feet.

Lastly, let’s not forget the ultimate foot-related power fantasy—leaving footprints in the snow. Skyrim’s dynamic weather and terrain mean that every step you take leaves a mark on the world. There’s something almost poetic about tracing your own steps, seeing the path your feet have carved through this sprawling landscape.

In the end, Skyrim is a game that celebrates the journey as much as the destination, and nothing embodies that journey more than the feet that carry you through it. Whether you’re trudging through snow, leaping over streams, or just admiring the sound of your own footsteps in a quiet forest, Skyrim is the ultimate foot-focused fantasy. So lace up your boots—or don’t—and step into the world of Skyrim, where every footstep is an adventure waiting to happen.",1724892686,1724892686,True,2,2,0.5217071175575256,0,True,False,False,False,72850,20250114_132020,positive,100

Who doesn't know Skyrim given it re-released so many times it probably has fridge version somewhere too. Unsurprising though, I think it still holds title of the best Bethesda title.

All TES games have that, so do Fallouts...apparently not Starfield ;p
It's probably not the best TES entry but it's best balanced in terms of looking good, alright systems and passable writing. Certainly most accessible entry as well and, again, 2nd 3rd and 5th life breathed into it through mods.

[b][u] STORY - 7/10[/u][/b]
Straight forward narrative of the main quests where much better stories are told through the major side-quests (Thieves Guild is the best of the lot). However, much of the side cast is plain, boring or just one-dimensional with some rare exceptions like Alduin, Parthenaax & Jarl Ulric. 

[b][u] GAMEPLAY - 6/10[/u][/b]
Simple, straight forward, but still extremely outdated even for its time. I mostly enjoy the concept of its leveling system of the more you do something, the better you become at it. As well as the freedom in gameplay where there is no limitation to your build. Dungeons are extremely grindy and boring after a while and even the Shouts end up mostly being defaulted with Fus Ra Da.

[b][u] VISUALS - 6/10[/u][/b]
Fairly outdated visuals unless you mod the crap out of it. Easiliy the weakest aspect of this game and don't even get me started on the number of bugs and glitches I've come across (which actually makes this game more fun for some reason :/ ).

[b][u] MUSIC - 8/10[/u][/b]
Iconic soundtrack that gets my blood pumping.

It’s the ultimate fantasy RPG, where the only limit is your imagination—or, more accurately, the 5,000 mods you’ve downloaded hoping the last one of which doesn't brick your game.

The true Skyrim experience begins the moment you discover mods. Why settle for regular dragons when you can replace them with Macho Man Randy Savage, screaming “OH YEAH” as they barrel through the sky? Why have a boring, standard-issue horse when you can ride Thomas the Tank Engine into battle? Bethesda may have built the framework, but modders turned it into a masterpiece.

Want to crank the immersion up to 11? Download a survival mod that makes you eat, sleep, and freeze to death if you forget to pack socks. Want to turn every NPC into a Shrek lookalike? There’s a mod for that, too. 

And don’t even get me started on the graphics mods. By the time you’re done installing ENBs and 8K textures, Skyrim looks so beautiful it makes real life feel like a low-res cutscene. Sure, your PC might sound like it’s trying to launch itself into orbit, but who cares? You’ve got ray-traced lighting and NPCs with pores more detailed than your actual face.

The modding community is where Skyrim truly shines. Want to replace dragons with Thomas the Tank Engine? Go for it. Want to turn Whiterun into a modern city? Done. Mods make Skyrim the ultimate playground of chaos and creativity.

Elden Ring is a masterpiece in many aspects: beautifully executed in terms of lore, soundtracks, environments, particle effects, cinematics and dialogues. I finished the DLC (I didn't complete everything because no Steam trophies duh) and I couldn't be more disappointed than this. The DLC costs 40 dollars, which is worth the money only for the sheer amount of things that have been implemented and added to the base game. In many aspects, with some more tuning a bit of stuff, you could have released this as a spin-off or sequel of Elden Ring for 60 dollars and nobody would have complained about it. The DLC is even more beautiful than the base game, I sincerely believe that From Software hit its peak in terms of art department. The graphics are simply stunning, the areas rich and vibrant and you could almost forget the obscene amount of unfairness and incompetence that they keep putting into the gameplay...Almost. My personal advice for such a great company: do not produce videogames, switch to graphic novels/movies/books or something that does not include complex gameplay mechanics. You cannot make a decent game gameplay-wise even if your life depends on it, exception made for your only technically well executed game, which is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. 

These are the issues of this game:
1. Bosses are completely unfair, hitboxes are completely unfair, camera is completely unfair, everything is complete and utter bs in the DLC, 10 times more than the base game. A single swing of a sword passes over you by a mile and you still get hit, you touch the back of the head of a hyppopotamus and get teleported into his mouth, you press R1 in front of the staggered boss and you do not trigger the critical hit, or you hit R1 way further than you should and you get teleported into the critical hit, the particle effects of a boss move prevent you from seeing what's the boss next move, the 5th combo piece of boss triggers randomly, so you cannot plan to trade after the 4th attack;
2. Everything has been designed to screw you over without any consideration about the gameplay itself: spending 10 minutes hitting the legs of a giant furnace that oneshots you just to drop a useless item, parkouring yourself on the roofs of the final legacy dungeon just to find a useless item. Why would anyone even care about exploring a map that's 95% empty, 4% filled with garbage and 1% filled with interesting stuff? I explored and got 90% of the useful stuff during the first playthrough just because I'm obsessive about leaving something behind and boy I will never do it again. Do you want to make a compelling open world game? Learn something from Zelda: BoTW, where any single corner of the map has something quick, easy and rewarding to do, instead of filling an entire area of enemies that two-shots you so you can loot an excrement (literally);
3. Map expansion was incredibly linear and boring in the base game, very good job implementing a map that dives deep in the ""vertical"" dimension, just to completely screw any player over because you just couldn't make a map representation that could be remotely intuitive to navigate. Why not adding some vertical layers you could navigate in the map menu? It has already been done with Underground Map (Siofra river for example) and Normal map;
4. The damage the enemies deal in the DLC is utter bs and the balance system around the scadutree fragment is the laziest solution you could ever think of: you basically have a chunk of another game stitched to the main one, with zero connection and zero continuity, except for the lore. You talk with Miquella arm and you are projected into Elden Ring 2. Separate map, separate mobs, separate balance system, separate everything: God forbid you could make everything work organically without needing to add external parameters to make things artificially harder;
5. Game difficulty. Now, this is a very controversial point. I do not care if a game is complex and difficult, I care how the difficulty has been realised. Chess is an incredibly complex game but the complexity comes from the well thought design: every piece moves in a certain way and the combination of the moves is what increases the difficulty. Elden Ring is artificially inflated with unnecessary, dull defects or shenanigans just to reach a level of difficulty that satifies whoever sadist is in charge of executing the gameplay design. I wonder how the game would be without broken camera, broken hitboxes, more than 0 quality of life features (hey they added the (!) to new items, it took 10 years but they actually did something good QoL wise) and boss patterns that are not completely governed by RNG. There is a difference between a challenge and playing a rigged game, and the latter is exactly how it feels to play Elden Ring SotE, unless you rig it yourself by using Spirit Ashes and many other tools that devoid you from any challenge and allow you to appreciate Elden Ring in the only way you could: without actually playing it.",1721084921,1721084921,False,16,2,0.5714146494865417,4,False,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,negative,100

I think the game is not bad and it should be played. The reason I am writing a negative review is that I am fed up with the stupid design choices that have been continuing since Dark Souls 1, and no one is talking about the [u] obvious problems [/u] of Elden Ring. I will point out the game's flaws in my own way, hoping that maybe, even if it's just a small chance, other players will do the same, and they will make this quality game even better.

[h2] NPC Questlines [/h2]
The same classic silly setup that has been continuing since Dark Souls 1 persists in this game as well. The difficulty of completing NPC quests and coming across them [strike] let's admit it, 90% of players complete these quests by looking at guides. [/strike] , but even if I overlook that, the progression of the quests is the same. We press the interaction button repeatedly with NPCs who stand like statues. After doing this three times in different locations, the NPC quest is completed. Sure, at the end of some quests we fight and so on, but the process is the same: press the talk button, then press it again at the next location, and continue. I wonder if anyone is genuinely affected by these mostly depressive NPC stories. There are no cutscenes or cinematic settings; they are just immobile statues. This needs to be improved

[h2] Open World [/h2]
Elden Ring has a much larger map compared to its previous games, but this beautiful and large map is filled with many repetitive bosses and identical dungeons even the creatures inside the dungeons are the same However, the thing that most undermines the sense of exploration is this: you're traveling in a location, defeating enemies specifically placed to frustrate the player, and the result? You are rewarded with crappy material or an item you won't even remember the name of. Instead of these useless items, they should include enemy armor sets, weapons, and items with different low drop rates. This would make the sense of exploration much more satisfying and save players from meaningless and unenjoyable grinding.

[h1] Storyline and narrative [/h1]
:D

[h2] The Bosses [/h2]
The bosses in Elden Ring are really great, both in terms of design, environment, and patterns. Generally, they are good, but it's clear that some are filled with unnecessary aoe damage and sometimes excessively high damage just to make the boss fight very difficult and frustrating for players. I'm not saying the bosses impossible to beat. I believe the aoe combos they  should be balanced, and the damage they inflict should be slightly reduced.

The DLC is *very* good, and more worth it than most modern games even after bumped down to the same price range.

But there are *four* problems in specific, one of which is SotE specific.

1. Scadutree Blessings

On paper, its an interesting idea. To reiterate what they are: they are items that you need to ""level up"" for the DLC's specific frame of leveling. These can boost your numbers *quite* substantially, moreso than basic equipment upgrades or even levels can. Sekiro had something like it, and it was generally enjoyed -- or not cared about -- there. But Sekiro is a comparatively linear, more mechanically-minimalist game than Elden Ring is, being more along the lines of a character action game than a widely open-ended RPG. Here, there are *so* many of them, and *so* many blessings. People will say ""this incentivizes exploration."" But Elden Ring already did that. Either by having a variety of items to find -- oftentimes said items were of the quest/key variety -- or going in whichever direction you want to gain levels. Both of these things are a strength of the base game, especially as the former are generally in rare and more obviously-located supply. Moreover, NPC questlines often dictated if there would even *be* something in a corner of the game world. While Scadutree fragments are *generally* found at Golden Crosses, many others are dropped by somewhat unassumingly-designed enemies, that are often placed into basic foliage and enemy-filled fields, which they may blend into. Many people consider several of the bosses in this, even with Scadutree Blessings, to rank among the hardest in the developer's catalog. This raises two questions: if bosses are going to be that hard anyways, then what's really the point of having this new power system, besides stalling the early game? Secondly, now it's not ""I have to go level up"" or ""keep trying a boss until I get better at it."" It's ""I have to now go scrape the corners of the game world, possibly so I can even stand a chance."" In the basegame you had choice of what you wanted to farm for levels. Here, you may have to pull up a googled checklist if you're not agonizingly thorough. This effectively will hamper replay value, as it will no longer be ""just explore"" on replays -- it will be ""do the checklist,"" ontop of the existing checklist baked into the games core. The basegame could effectively be mostly ignored, and that was one of its strengths. All in all, Scadutree fragments remind me of the MMO-style ""borrowed power"" system. Anyone who knows that is groaning reading this. Borrowed power was a system where, at the end of each expansion, you lost the power you had last expansion that you only gained through tremendous grinding. Moreover, on alt-characters, it made you have to redo the whole grinding experience again just to do the content your other characters can do. In some cases, you even sort of lost it with each patch. In effect, it made the levels and gear you did have seem like they didn't really matter. Most MMOs have removed this system by now, or streamlined it, or still have it as sticking points to great expansions. Now why is this in the expansion? To make sure that it's hard? Levels after a *certain point* effectively stop mattering, and most players would be *around* that point anyways. It would already be very hard if you set the difficulty *for* that level range. Moreover, the game has baked-in ways to make it hard, like NG+, not using summons, or special ""debuff"" rings. Or, just, not levelling, or going effectively naked. Scadutree Blessings are unnecessary that in the long-term are a chore, and other mediums of this scope -- which were built *for* these systems -- have proven these systems redundancy.

2. Boss design

Some of these bosses, like Rellana, are astounding. But we're quickly reaching a point where the developer can't *do* really anything else to keep making encounters ""harder."" People already have griped about bosses doing their flips and acrobatics and 15-hit rush-attack chains, but I don't think anyone's yet elaborated on *why* this is so much of a problem. Bloodborne and Sekiro gave you the speed to constantly trade with the boss, or built-in tools to effectively stop almost any boss in their tracks. Here, it still *plays* like Dark Souls, and you even have a load of super cool weapons and spells with really elaborate combo's, but you effectively can't use them. Either the bosses never stop moving, or you can't stagger anything worth enough to get more than one hit in. Without the mechanics of poise -- and a defense value on gear that matters -- heavy builds are subject to ""just backpedal until you hit them once."" Super light weapons like daggers seem effectively pointless compared to a straight sword, outside of the sparse few times you may land a crit -- for which there are already rings to better facilitate. As a bow user myself, the only real effective way to use a bow in a boss -- normal, not greatbow -- is to just spam rain of arrows, or just keep jumping backwards while shooting. Bloodborne gave bosses -- like the Cleric Beast -- weak spots you could shoot or throw grenades at, and this would cripple the boss in some way -- also allowing for an easy crit. That doesn't really exist here, and even if it did, bosses move around too much to make the shot feasible or worthwhile. All the ""hard"" bosses effectively play the same in this regard. They rarely stand out anymore. It feels like FROMSOFTWARE has played all its hands if it keeps wanting to go in this direction, and if they're adamant about not adding the convenience the other games provided. We all by now probably know about the popularity boost Kai Cenat gave this game. The strategies he often used -- just spamming one weapon art on a good weapon every fifteen or twenty seconds -- are far too commonplace and far too necessary.

3. Patches

I don't mean the NPC, he's a real one. No, I mean how FROMSOFTWARE games have started to treat their patches like Destiny 2 patches. Prime example in *this* DLC: Hoarfrost Stomp. Used to be super good. Is still *very* good. But one of the new stomp-based attacks, effectively, is just what Hoarfrost Stomp was pre-nerf. Why would they even bother, then? At least Destiny 2 has a live-service element to it, and even still, that's *still* scummy there. Moreover, weapon values like, again, lighter weapons, have had their poise damage value on enemies reduced. Some of the lighter enemies, then, effectively have movement frames that effectively nullify the value of these lighter weapons -- being able to hit and shut down enemies that move a lot -- compared to something akin to a straight sword. Thislive-service-like balancing is confusing more than anything else. Nerfing things just because you'll add something better in a DLC or patch, is effectively just planned obsolescence. The multiplayer component of this game is not *that* big of a focus, despite what the community will say, so that's not much of an excuse either. Buildcrafting is what *makes* replays of these games. 

4. Invasions

The system is breaking. Being able to only really invade groups, means you have no reason to face them head-on. DS3 had the invader Sunbros. Why is this not back? Alternatively: a system to queue into an ""invasion lobby"" with others. Or, hell, just let a solo invader use a summon. Instead, outside of community-imposed dueling arenas, invasions are just both parties standing there until one side gets bored enough to leave, the invader commits kms, or the invader needs cheese strats. With the invader continuously running, something like a battle royale ""timed death wall"" is needed to force both parties to come together to just fight each other and stop wasting each others time. Or, at least, something like Giant Tree Seeds from 2.",1719251190,1719251190,False,19,1,0.5428774356842041,3,True,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,negative,100

I recently built my PC using a 4090 GPU and an Intel Core I9-14900K CPU and I'm met with constant stutters during fights right when the boss attacks. In some rare instances, the game stutters for around 2 seconds, then I lose the ability to control my character as i watch them go in circles until either I die or reset the game even though my controller isn't disconnected. The problem persist regardless of my graphic settings, whether I'm playing on High or Low and I saw online that this was a constant issue after purchasing. I wanted to see if something similar happens in other games like Monster Hunter World, and it ran smoothly on Max settings. 

In my own opinion, I also didn't find many bosses fun to fight. I know souls games are built around dying and learning for next time, but this one felt especially malicious. I played a Dex/Faith build and didn't want to use summons because I was interested in learning the Boss patterns only to find many boring. Many of the bosses rarely stagger if at all and so many bosses work off 3 different variations of attacks: one that makes you roll, one that baits and catches rolls, and one that punishes X amount of weak attacks. Going in the first few times means you have to die because the game is so focused on tripping you up with long winded attacks than interesting boss fights. Once I broke the attacks patterns down to this, the game got really boring since every death felt like it only existed to find out what attacks are delayed and nothing else. My learning process coupled with the stuttering before every other attack from the boss made playing this game miserable, because it was difficult to figure out what was a delayed attack or what specific actions I can do in between a boss' animations when the game locks up for 1 second and its a coin flip whether it skips ahead or leaves me where I left off. Luckily, the stutters seemed to end around late game, but that could've been because many late game battles were in enclosed areas.

Another issue I have is that many dungeons feel repetitive or scummy. I've explored everything I came across, and I can't count the times an enemy was right behind a door, playing dead or on the ceiling waiting to gang up on me the second I entered. In my opinion it isn't ""hard"" to deal with ambushes, It's just extremely frustrating after seeing in practically every dungeon in similar fashion.

at the time of posting this, I just finished base game and will play SotE too. I hope the issue's I have aren't as prevalent and I find more enjoyment there, but right now I wouldn't recommend this game based on my own perspective on the gameplay and the poor optimization on PC.",1720150585,1720150671,False,19,3,0.5396537184715271,0,True,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,negative,100

Decent game for everyone that I would recommend.
[u]DLC[/u]: Unreasonable combat that clashes with its already outdated mechanics, but it's an even prettier hell of a world. The DLC is NOT something I'd recommend to most people.

I liken the Elden Ring experience to eating a spicy dish. Fromsoftware's games have always been a bit obtuse, and just like spicy food it's not really for everyone. So it's a bit of delight when they get so much recognition. They make good curry.

The base Elden Ring game is a bit of a foray into newness for them because they haven't ever made a world this big yet, and that comes with advantages and disadvantages. For one, the world it's set in is gorgeous and fun to really just traverse in; that however means there's a whole bunch of empty space not occupied by corridors and enemies. It also extends the amount of time for a single run for the average player, which depending on who you are is a good or a bad thing. Overall I think the game has really good presentation thanks to its visual language, its visages, the music that flows between ambient and bombastic when needed, and just the strange and mysterious elements that fascinate a lot of their audience.

The DLC is all of these things and more, and that's not necessarily a good thing; just like how it's not always a good thing to make a dish spicier. The expansion adds a whole new map that's a bit more compact, but it shares a lot of the same characteristics of the base game. It's really pretty and I like how a lot of enemies and architecture that just juxtapose itself with that of the base game. The story that unfolds uncovers a few of the things that never really got an explanation at all, and you meet characters are much more likeable albeit their brief appearances.

What's absolutely unacceptable is their decision to make combat so unbalanced and nonsensical. The base game occasionally has issues where enemies would just spin on the spot and hit you, and that unintuitive and silly implementation is everywhere in the expansion. They also have been entertaining this obtuse way of breaking people's reflexive response by delaying attacks in awkward ways, and it's excruciating egregious in the DLC. On top of that, they decided tough enemies should just attack endlessly without any good indicators of when their attacks end. They basically broke every rule of a real time combat game and instead of making them some pioneer into the genre, it makes Elden Ring's combat unreasonable. The DLC exacerbates this problem instead of solving it, and that alone makes me incapable of recommending this to anyone despite how much I love the rest of the game.

I think Fromsoft cooked a bit too hard this time around.

I think its a beautiful game to play, to experience, to explore with an art direction unmatched by most AAA titles. However, come the DLC, the game performance is now pretty much straight dogshit. 

The game has huge performance issues since day 1, and the DLC somehow made it worse (yes, even the base game performance somehow got worse). If you played any PC Dark Souls at launch, you know they all have varied performance issues, but Elden Ring is the first to get to completely unplayable at points. In the same castle, you can get wildly different performance from one corner to another. Sometimes even moving the camera seems daunting. This wouldn't be much of an issue if Elden Ring wasn't an action game that required precise reaction. Imagine at least 20+ frame drops, or even sudden freezing, when you tried to dodge all the fireworks the bosses spits out.

I really could talk about how this game pushes almost every aspect to it's peak. However, after much thought and deliberation - I am going to have to give the game a ""not recommended"" review, to be clear, I would absolutely recommend the game to anyone into souls likes or RPGs. However, considering the sheer number of Elden Ring copies sold and therefore the massive amount of revenue / profit From Software would have received from both Elden Ring and it's recently released DLC (I'm looking at a report saying that 5 million units of the DLC have been sold). I simply cannot look past the incredibly outdated technical presentation, the game is still locked at 60 fps, the game still has a huge amount of stutter issues and still drops frames below 60 fps even on a more than capable machine. They should use a comparatively very small portion of their profits to reinvest in their technology, hire a team to focus on getting the performance up to what the industry expects in 2024.

Firstly, the dodge, back-step and print are all burnt to a single key, which is quite literally the worst way to set up the fighting, and the customisation for the keys is pathetic, it won't allow me to use half my keyboard to bind including CAPS, for some reason i can't bind caps to anything even though its really useful right about left shift, its not like i'm gonna be doing any typing while playing. Poor game design.

Secondly, there's no world exploring is this game, you can never just explore and admire the devs creation, there's always something attacking you, it just makes the game annoying, Its like the devs failing at trying to make the game harder but don't know how so they just make it annoying.

Third, there are multi boss fights where the boss will lock on to the player in an attack any no matter how much you dodge or roll to the left side of the boss the fucking thing will just pivot on the spot not even move its legs, to land a guaranteed attack. Along with it is the smaller knight fights as well, when he thrusts forward and I dodge to his left ending up attacking him from behind, he shouldn't be able to pivot his whole fucking body around to immediately face me and attack me. and finally on this is the RNG, its so BAD, ill go through a fight 7 TIMES and the enemy apparently just INVENTS a new move to just to waste my entire health bar. All this is just some DUMB shit I have had to deal with while playing this game. Poor fight design.

FOURTH, aggro switching, the AI that runs the aggro on all of the bosses is the WORST I have EVER seen in a game, the boss can NEVER decide who it wants to attack. I literally have a video where Radagon smashes his hammer 3 times each FACING MY MIMIC, but LANDING ON ME> POOR FUCKING GAME DESIGN.
Messer is the WORST for agro, I can have my mimic to an ancient dragon lighting attack that does 4000 damage but the waste of coding will CONTINUE to focus on me, giving me no time to rebuff or heal. POOR GAME DESIGN.

FIFTH, Fusing moves. The game straight up has some bosses doing to completely different moves right after another, most of the time using two attacks into the same time frame, overlapping the attack making it impossible to dodge. Even powerful moves, no wind up, no build up, just straight into the next attack no matter have heavy or light the attack is. This of course sends the timing of everything in a boss fight off. Poor fight design.

SIXTH, Unresponsive game play. Countless times I have pressed the button to get of my horse, heal, switch weapon, OPEN UP THE INVENTORY, and the game decides is doesn't want to do it. Bug mainly.

SEVENTH, broken pairing. the game straight doesn't even block the shot or stun the enemy some times. Bug mainly.

EIGHTH, Whoever the fuck decided it would be a good idea to not allow player to interact with the map while the game is in ""fight mode"", is literally a dumbass. I could be randomly exploring through the Luna Lakes and I go to open my map cuz I dont know where the fuck I am but I CAN'T, cuz the GAME decided that I should be fighting some random useless enemy that I rode past on my horse. MORE POOR GAME DESIGN.

NINTH, Inconsistent starting moves, I entire into a boss fight and have no idea if the game is going to allow me to summon and vow or straight up start attacking me. This inconsistent bullshit is called POOR GAME DESIGN.

TENTH, COPE MOVES, boy of oh does this game love cope moves. Doing to much damage to the boss?? Dodged to many of his attacks??? Well expect to be insta killed by either a whole health bar wiping attack that apparently hit you.........the boss performing there most powerful attack up to 7 times or until your death........ the boss stung locking you until you die or the boss performing their entire moves multiple times with no punishment windows until you die or run out of stamina. 
The worst bosses for this are, Magma Wyrm spamming the lava spewing walk attack 6 times IN A ROW, Melania performing water foul dance 4 times in a row.,Messer spamming hot trust attacks 12 times in a row, Godfrey(both forms) performing 7 stomp attacks in a row, Dancing Lion performing lightning attack 4 times in a row, Red Wolf of Radagon performing 5, 4 magic swords summons in a row, ETC.

ELEVENTH, Poor boss AI, the game struggles like REALLY STRUGGLES to choose the correct attack. The devs did a TERRIBLE job coding in, distance reading, stamina reading, health reading, attack list reading and input reading into some of the bosses.
Having a boss randomly jump back, run forward, spin around, swipe or change its attack mid air is not even fun, its straight up annoying, there's no satisfaction from killing a boss as it was all just RNG.

TWELFTH, pretty simple, the attack option that comes from breaking an enemies stance or sneaking up behind straight up doesn't work sometimes. Bug mainly.

THIRTEENTH, NPC being more powerful than bosses. Like having a random NPC that is more powerful than a boss is straight up stupid. (examples>Crucible Knight, Craian Knight(DLC), some dragons, Banished Knight, dogs(I Swear), etc). I never thought simply running pasts a bunch of NPCs would be so fucking annoying.

Note: I have SEVERAL videos of everything stated above. And I have already posted some.

Following, because of everything attacking you the game becomes repetitive and straight up boring making this game not worth my money at all. So game is blatantly unplayable on PC so you always have to use a controller. 

I ended up going into NG+1 to see if it was still, but nope it's the same poor game design. Additionally the fact that I have to go through an entire new game just for another ending on pc is straight up PATHETIC on the devs behalf, it makes the game so fucking boring having to face the same enemies all over again and even stronger just to get a different ending.

Lastly, ended up in the DLC to see if the devs fixed anything but it turns out they didn't. turns out putting the same boss fight format into your DLC makes it really boring. Additionally, all the boss fights in the DLC are pretty easy excluding Mesmer and Radahn, having to hear the  SAME LINES and the SAME starting animation and to die about 50 times to those two, for not even the same reasons. Its so REPETITIVE, its literally fucking BORING. I ACTUALLY got bored trying to fight those useless wastes of coding. If you it take more than 50 tries to beat a boss, it is no longer still, its RNG, (For example, 1 in 50 chance the Melania never does her water foul dance during the boos fight, ENTIRELY RNG).

Originally the beautiful world, easy bosses, mid lore (wow everyone is related and incest), decent quests, fun weapons and good ending (Rannis one) sorta evened out the horrendous bullshit. bbbbuuuuuttttttttt now they added the DLC with more boring, repetitive bullshit and nothing else of value so it just a dumpster fire now.

The game is a nightmare chore, boring, and indifferent from dark souls 3, except environment and lore wise.

You spend the majority of your time riding a horse named Torren to the point you just wish he would go faster so you can get to your destination. You enjoy the artistic scenery at first, but then you get frustrated with the game overall, since the entire game is just boring tombs and ruins to explore.

The amount of recycled content from dark souls incorporated into this game is unbelievable, you would think this was a passion project, but even the enemies are recycled from dark souls 1, 2, and 3. The boss fights are tedious and boring, Mogh sounds like a love ridden teenage child, and I haven't got the basic clue on why I should even care about the Elden Tree, Marika, and anything else.

In Dark Souls it felt like you had a mission, in Elden Ring, you just feel like some trespasser without any real goal, or will of your own. Because of all the boring empty land space, you spend 80% of your time just riding around looking to explore, missing npcs to advance their quest lines because you didn't see they were kneeling on the ground.

The game is beautiful in a way, and it sort of feels like a world, but the game feels rushed, incomplete, and you spend more time looking for something to kill. In Dark Souls you had enemy after enemy, even in this game they used the white wolf from dark souls 3 dlc, and scaled it down.

I just want the game to end at this point, after I have explored everything and got at least 95% completion, the game is honestly for try hards without any achievement in their life except, and judge their worth by how ""gud"" they are in Elden Ring.

[H1]THE GOOD[/H1]
Exploring the world and progressing.

While the game's approach to no quest log or markers is not for me, honestly, I will applaud the game here. Reading a wiki on my phone vs opening a map in game and walking to a marker isn't fundamentally different. For people who DO find this fun, good for them, and I'm happy to see a game cater to that.

Personally, spent as much time on wiki's / reddit as I did in game because I just couldn't figure it out where to go or what to do once I was there. New dungeons take a long time to explore. Unless you have 2+ free hours to play, don't bother. You won't be able to make it anywhere. I didn't find it immersive to roam around aimlessly for play session after play session. 

[H1]THE BAD[/H1]
There's next to no plot, and the lore is nonsense.

The controls are purposefully bad. Swapping weapons, activating abilities, and using consumables requires scrolling through them one by one. Almost all moves have excessive input buffering, so double tapping a button or mis-pressing a button can easily force your character into a long, uninterruptible, actions.

[H1]THE UGLY[/H1]
The RPG and character building aspects were my favorite part. There is *ton* of depth in how to build out a character. Additionally the game does a good job of presenting different challenges that require exploration and adaptation from the player. Unfortunately, all of the systems needed to build a character are hidden (respecs, access to enough upgrade materials). This makes the game twice as hard and unforgiving when you encounter an obstacle and *nothing* in your current arsenal will help. So in practice, until you're deep into the game and really understand the nuances of character customization, the RPG elements are yet another piece that punishes, frustrates, and turns the game into a slog.

[H1]Seamless Co-Op Mod[/H1]
Seamless Co-Op is a totally different game, and very fun. The build limitations in the early through mid game lessen with a second person who can fill ability gaps. Exploration is much faster, more sets of eyes to spot places to try to get to, and more attempts before having to respawn. Places where the game is punishing, slipping up in combat, jumping to your death, can be funny from the other player's perspective. Finally, the moments of the game that have the big exciting payouts (killing a tough boss or figuring out a tricky puzzle) are even more exciting with friends to celebrate with you.",1706645599,1706645599,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879,0,True,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,negative,100

I even killed Malenia. I can say with confidence that this game is the biggest scam in the gaming industry in recent times.

The game has amazing visuals, it has a stunning style and atmosphere. But Miyazaki gradually destroys even those only positive features that the game has.

I would even call Elden Ring an ideal NON-game. It is a collection of certain game mechanics that could have been quite successful, but it is in combination that they break and stop working.

I will immediately make a reservation, the author of the game has a huge fan base that denies all the disadvantages of the game, citing the fact that the player simply has not trained his skill enough. I am not even going to argue with these strange people, some of whom would do well to visit a drug addiction specialist and find a job.

I would like my review to save time and money of people who can be deceived by an advertising company.

In short, the game is bad in absolutely everything that can call one game a video game:

- The game's lore is a rather mediocrely written mythology that is not interesting to understand. In addition, it does not deserve the time and effort required to unravel this tangle

- There is simply no plot in the game. Remember the terminals with stories from Fallout 76? Now imagine that the terminal with chapter number 3 is not in the third cave, but at the other end of the map. And to get there, first level up and kill a couple dozen bosses. And all this so that when you get to this stage of the game, you will safely forget what you were looking for at all

- Nothing motivates you to cover huge distances back and forth on the map and look for a boss suitable for your character level and skill

- And most importantly, the combat mechanics are simply disgusting. This is something Miyazaki should be fired from the industry for and even jailed. This is exploitation of gambling mechanics to get you to try and try the boss, wasting hours of your time. Are these bosses difficult? No, the game is just cheating. This is not Zelda, where you can fence and dodge real enemy animations, and be sure that your hitbox does not match the enemy's hitbox. And where the enemy reacts exactly to the beginning of your hero's animation. No. In this game, the enemy's movements do not match the animations. And the hitboxes do not match. Imagine playing an online MMO, where the boss cast a fireball at you, but you hid behind a wall. The fireball will still fly at you and cause damage, because it was already written into the code on the server. The same goes for Elden Ring, if the boss strikes and the code says it should hit you, then nothing will help, even if it seems to you that you made a perfect dodge and the axe flies past - in a few seconds it will be magnetized right at you and you will die, even if there is half a map between you and the boss. Miyazaki wants you to memorize these features for hours and use a certain ability in time so as not to die.

- Well, you can forget about scaling. You can level up as much as you want, but you will still fly away from ordinary monsters with one hit throughout the entire game. You will not be allowed to enjoy the locations. Death and anxiety all the time. By the way, you will die many times because of the crooked camera and the inability to hit an ordinary monster in time due to some problems with the animation

- I quit the game not because I can't beat the boss. No. I am completely ready for it, I just don't enjoy running away from respawn every time after death, because Miyazaki decided here too that respawn will not be in front of the arena with the boss, but far from this place and on the way there will be several strong opponents who kill with one hit. Why do I need this?

I'll try to keep this concise and clear so my arguments won't be misconstrued in any way.

- The difficulty
The DLC is too hard, but it's in a different way than you might think off of a first reaction to that statement. The DLC gives you these fragments that you have to explore and collect in order to do any worthwhile damage to the bosses and enemies of the game. With the fragments the bosses are still more difficult compared to even end game bosses, but in the classic from-soft style where learning the moves and dodging is engaging and fun. Without the fragments its absolutely horrible and that's where a lot of criticism about the difficulty is coming from. My main issue is that this fragment system should even exist in the first place and that it is clearly a poor fix from poor game design decisions made early in the games  development. Let me break it down a little bit better.

-Why do the fragments exist?
     Because the game needs a way for you progress without throwing off the difficulty of the main experience.

-Why are people complaining about difficulty when these fragments exist?
     Because the game makes exploration monotonous and tedious for almost the entirety of the DLC. As if it's punishing you for trying to explore before a difficult boss fight.

I wanna talk a little bit more about that first one. This game has the fragments purely because they don't want your main game character to be insanely powerful, and that's okay. I can absolutely understand and get behind that. The issue is however that to even have a decent chance at the DLC you need to be around lvl 150-200 which is endgame/post-endgame. So why have this system in the first place if it doesn't even matter anymore how strong your character is??? It absolutely feels as if From-software wanted to make this game take place around the section of the main story where you enter the main city (Godfrey and Morgott) but quickly realized that the core design of these characters for the dlc are simply too difficult to be place still so early into the game. Which is FINE!!! But, instead of working with the balancing to make it work as an addition to the endgame parts of the main game they implemented the fragment system which only work if you literally look over every single inch of land or use a guide, and that just isn't satisfying for me and majority of other players. It's not that the bosses themselves are too difficult, it's that the entire area meant to prepare you for said bosses are just horribly designed for a game of this type that has been made into an open world game. I have a lot to say about the base quest design but ill mostly save that. I will say that, with Elden Ring being a game that allows you to go anywhere, having quests that are designed for you never to progress past a certain point without giving you any warning or heads up that going here will ruin the quest-line is absolutely bad game design. It's like they took the quest design of DS1-3 and bloodborne and threw it into an open world setting regardless of whether that particular way of designing quests works for a game as large as Elden Ring. Because that is literally what they did. I say this as a fan and as someone who loves this game and the DLC bosses very dearly. I say this because I want this game to be better, I'm not trying to prove something to myself about how i'm better than other players, I just simply want to have the satisfying gameplay that these games have never failed on before, until at least now.

-Performance.
This right here is the main thing that got me to make the review, everything else I could have easily lived with and still gotten a decent amount of enjoyment from, but this is downright reprehensible for a game of Elden Rings size. I don't know why so many people give this game a pass when it comes to performance. First it was Bloodbornes horrible frame pacing and now it's this DLC that from a technical viewpoint is EMBARRASSING for a AAA company. At the lowest settings I am getting sub 30 frames on an RTX 3060 with a decent CPU. This game is reaching sub 30 on even the PS5 and XBOX Series X performance settings. Literally how is this in any way acceptable. I love this game to bits but jesus christ being able to play it would be nice. I have a good pc and even a console copy but neither of them provide anything I'd call close to an enjoyable performance experience. From-software should be ashamed of releasing this DLC in the state that it's in. Amazing bosses can't outdo the damage that's been done to the core experience of the game. It's embarrassing for it to be this way and for people to defend it as if those rightfully complaining are just poor at the game. Stop excusing bad game design. I want this game to be hard, but this simply breaks the core of what makes soulsbourne games so satisfying.

Replay ability:
I enjoy games with replay ability, ie Monster Hunter, Mass Effect 1 & 2, but for some reason, this game doesn't give a good feeling replaying it, i have 130 hrs currently on this and on my 2nd play thru with 1 character. I just feel like its a chore to do another play thru, (I get that others will have a different opinion on this, just my take).

 Multiplayer: 
I like multiplayer games as much as anyone, I don't mind getting my steam and IRL friends games so that we can specifically play multiplayer, but FROMSOFT failed at this, why do I or another player need to craft items to play? took me and a friend like 30 mins to set up multiplayer, and we killed 1 boss, and that was it, we played for about 1 hour, and half that time was just trying to connect with each other. if the item used for multiplayer was in an infinite amount, that would be fine, but having to go thru the game world and look for materials to craft it and then play? 

Please FROMSOFT, fix the requirements for playing multiplayer Co-op. (though I understand returning to my characters world after a boss fight)

system requirements: 
I kinda understand the requirements and system being mostly catered to consoles, but i wish PC users had a better ""port"" or version of the game. I have a rather good system capable of playing in 4K and in Ultra-wide monitor as well, but having half my screen just black and only having 60 FPS is rather really meh, especially with the requirements at the time of release. 

some controls:
the mount ""Torrent"" is a nice touch since the base game is really big in design and having a faster way of travelling without fast travel is great, but this fails in controls same as MHRS (Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak) palamute controls, jank, the turning aspect feels so weird, like it becomes a little bit too rigid, if this makes sense.
lock on controls needs to be fixed a lot better, if there was an enemy right in front of me, and trying to lock onto them, it'll lock onto an enemy that's, half way from the map instead, how does that happen? and when i'm trying to lock onto an enemy a bit far away, it'll lock onto an enemy in my characters peripheral view on the left or right, why does this happen? is the lock on mode targeting centre of the screen? or is it targeting on the left/right of my screen? when do I know if im locking on a close or far enemy? this HUD/UI needs to be a bit clearer.

some stuff I wanna vent: 
Levelling the character stats, is... something I don't like that much, based on other games that have similar levelling system.
if i have to invest in health more than other stats, I don't really like this system, since you can upgrade weapons but not armour is just.... why even have armour and level health....... why can't we upgrade armour to have more defence stats? 
and why is it easier to upgrade some weapons than other weapons? why aren't ranged weapons good? these are questions i want answered, since i'd rather play range than close quarters. (Lemme cosplay as Turok man)

I'm a big fan of Dark Souls series and Elden Ring appeared to be Dark Souls 2 in the open world for me. It's fun how people hate DS2 and admire ER, utterly escaping the fact that the two games have much in common. ER has 238 bosses against 41 bosses of DS2. Also, here you will meet hoards of mobs and dogs at every corner. Stonesword key instead of Pharros lockstone. Both games describe the destruction of the kingdom and depict the protagonist as the chosen lord who must sit on a throne. ER even has its own Fume Knight - Draconic Tree Sentinel, an extremely over-leveled, broken boss whose duty is to kill ANY player at ANY level with 2-3 strikes. After the appearance of Yui Tanimura as a co-director in titles everything made sense to me. So I definitely don't understand the gamers who hate DS2, playing the same game in a new setting and saying that it's a masterpiece.

Here I'll try to explain step by step, why I don't like ER anymore and why it makes me sad.

1) Level design is the strongest part of the game and its first problem. ER isn't DS. Except well-made castles game contains a variety of fields, desolations, and woods. All the characters I met were spread across The Lands Between. Example Nepheli Loux. I met her in Stormveil Castle, then in Roundtable Hold, and then purely accidental in Village of the Albinaurics... Why? Level designers seriously though that players will visit that big stinky cavern in Liurnia first instead of Academy or Capital? The same formula worked well in the location-based games. In the open world idea of putting the quest characters in random places is stupid! The same situation is with Alexander, an amazing character with the saddest plotline. I met him at the Radahn Festival and, thanks to Wiki, got that he can be found at the beginning of the game. After The Festival Alexander was placed in the lake of lava, far away from any road at the edge of the map! Some characters, like Millicent, after saving stand in the wild with no reason to be there and without any chance to find them. 
 
2) I didn't get the story itself. In the beginning, I met many characters. To know who is who, I read Elden Wiki. Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin did a magnificent job describing the history of the world. It looks great... in the text. In the game, Miyazaki did his best to destroy it with maximum disrespect. The absence of information is his strongest point! All characters remind me hard trained spies whose duty is to keep the information as best as possible; other NPS complain about something, giving info in an extremely dosed way; some heroes disappear for half of the game; another talking nonsense (my personal choice of dislike is Finger Reader Crones). A small number of in-game lore books might solve the problem. The expanded dialog window with NPS could also grant us some information. I mean it's an alternate reality game where we know nothing about the story of the world and its disasters in the beginning! 

3) Bosses. This is the biggest problem of ER. They are the soul of the souls games. Fighting with them is frustrating. I've heard many opinions about excellent combat mechanics, but behind this ""excellence"" hides the stupid idea of using combo attacks with input delay. Would you imagine, Morgott is able to jump and stop in the air for a second before strike! That's not fair and utterly ridiculous. Seeing ""the fog wall"", I knew that a new boss with the delayed attack was waiting there, and I must circle around him until learned all of his delayed movesets. It's similar to ""double clicking"" option in DS2. The parry is also broken. Instead of one parry player must parry twice against the strongest bosses. Why? Of course to make the dull fight longer. This is artificial difficulty and many enemies became annoying obstacles.

4) Crafting. There are so-o-o many in-game cookbooks that you can easily layout and print them to make a real-life book. In ER you will know how to craft items with tens of berries, flowers, fungus, insects, sprouts, liver, meat, bones, feathers, etc. Yes, this is what I expect when starting ""souls game"". I want to play Cooking Simulator! Give us more! Litter our inventory sack, so we try to find a rare useful item a little longer. Some of those crafted items are useful, like greases, others pointless trash (throwing pots, darts and daggers, soft cotton, even arrows). Rainbow stones - utterly useless item for we have Torrent in the field and the messages in the dungeons. ER is not Morrowind. This tinsel makes no use after leaving Stormveil Castle. Face it, all players are eager to find weapon equipment, armor, smithing stones or scrolls, not another bunch of berries!

4) Imitation of the living world. Is this supposed to be alive or dead? Mobs patrol the streets and ramparts, sometimes even clashing each other. Thank you for creating animals in the wild. So this world is definitely alive. Right? Then why do soldiers in Castle Morne look like undead from DS, but Warden Edgar looks normal? Why is Leyndell covered with the bodies and the royal knights walk the streets like it's an ordinary day? If this is an effect of The Scarlet rot, then how did it spread beyond Caelid region? Maybe The Shattering and destruction of The Golden Order caused this effect? According to wiki this order is a set of beliefs and The Shattering is a destructive civil war. Let's make it clear, The Lands Between are not dying, they were devastated by war. It seems Miyazaki was in need of another horde of undead mobs to copy Dark Souls. And, yes, magic explains everything.

5) Farum Azula. It is the worst location ever with the most confusing and horrible design. Hanging in the sky temple full of overleveled enemies, undead creatures with the ability to resurrect themselves. This is the traditional formula of Yui Tanimura: add as many enemies as possible and make them twice as strong as General Radahn, make the player run long distances again and again, add Dragon-boss who is able to oneshot you with lightning. This is what I wish to see after the breathtaking ending in the Mountaintops of the Giants. How did a hero appear there? Why I should waste my time jumping from platform to platform surrounded by enemies and archers and then jumping over the arena in try to get Beast Clergyman? The answer is to make gameplay longer and keep me away from the main plotline. 

So why did I stop playing? The answer is the bosses. They are boring. Beast Clergyman of Farum Azula was the final straw. It is sick when you enter into the fight and think not about the fight itself, but calculating how long will it take to press the dodge button before a delayed strike. Btw, the character's rolling and attacking input are also delayed by about 0.100s. All this makes the game dull math homework. It's fine when you meet 5-6 enemies behaving like this, but in ED 90% of bosses have delayed attacks. They are not difficult, they are annoying and the fight with them is time-taking. Moreover, I don't want to fight for the world I don't understand or interact with the characters who speak in riddles like the oracles. I would like to spend more time with Melina or Ranni, but the first girl appears at will and fights with me only once, while the second disappeared after her first introduction.

My verdict, Miyazaki became too lazy. Elden Ring is his worst creation, full of blank patches. I better go and play Dark Souls 2.",1705839506,1705839506,False,21,6,0.5140137076377868,20,True,False,False,False,1245620,20250114_132026,negative,100

One thing From Software does well is create interesting and well designed levels. Similar to the games that came before it the 'legacy dungeons' in this game are great. Thoughtful level design, secrets to find, good enemy placement, among other positives.  Excellent environments, etc. Which is why it's confusing to me that these dungeons are such a small part of the game. Instead the majority of the game will be spent outside of these areas in the large open world.

The vast majority of the open world will just be the same scattered nodes you can harvest for crafting materials coupled with uninteresting wildlife that can also be killed for crafting ingredients. In between you'll find various dungeons and crypts that all manage to feel similar to one another under a certain archetype. The mines look like mines. The crypts look like crypts. The caves look like caves. It brings me back to The Elderscrolls: Oblivion where Bethesda created like 10 or 20 generic tile sets per area and recycled these assets in different configurations to make different layouts for a dungeon that by the end of the journey you'll have seen dozens of times. If you've seen one crypt you'll have seen the same wall and floor designs dozens and dozens of times. Not to mention that the enemies are almost always the same as well.

Speaking of enemies.. Elden Ring has the largest number of unique enemies in any of the 'Soulslike' games. Yet when you play the game you will be continually disappointed when it feels like you're bumping into the same enemies over and over again. When it comes to bosses this is particularly annoying. The game subjects you to the same Ulcerated Tree Spirit boss like 10 times over the course of the game. Not to mention they even added these to the DLC. If anything they might slightly change the color palate of these enemies but ultimately it's the same boss patterns over and over again. On a positive note the one-of bosses are great. Those typically found in legacy dungeons, but sometimes out in the open world.  Additionally the weapons and combat feel as great as you'd expect.

I just think the open world design is what really holds back this game. The world feels much less like a tree with branching paths and more like an open field with various things you bump into here or there. The game has a lot of seeing something up on a cliff, or down in a valley, and having no idea how to get there. It could be any one of the various caves that will bring you out to the location you wanted to be. The vertical level design in that sense feels very flawed. I think this could have been helped with the various merchants around the game selling map markers or having them draw on your map to show connecting points. 

While I could get into the nittygritty about every little detail of what I liked and didn't like my ultimate feeling about the game is that it fell below my expectations. I'm a huge fan of the previous entries having started right from when the formula was really introduced with Demon's Souls. I hope that the next entries will return to the more handcrafted level design that we've known and loved out of From Software's games.

Souls games have never had deep combat comparatively to any other action game like Ninja Gaiden, Sifu, Devil May Cry, or even Sekiro from their own catalogue, but the issues which could be glossed over due to dense deeply lore rich worlds with tight enemy design and a cyclical world that loops round with satisfying shortcuts....can't anymore with Elden Ring. 

For starters, Elden Ring's open world is anathema to the tight Fromsoft design I'm used to: the dungeons come across as slightly better Chalice Dungeons from Bloodborne, and whilst there was a lot of novelty to them in Bloodborne, when you make so many, and litter so many with reoccurring bosses, whilst approaching them with a lego-like design, they become tedious, uninteresting, and vapid. If you want an example of modular dungeon design stretched across an open world then I'd argue Breath of the Wild handles it better because each Shrine (dungeon) is pithy, with a unique engaging puzzle that has a variety of methods to deal with it via the sandbox tools you've been given. It's not perfect...but it's a lot better than this slop.

I can list so many bosses off the top of my head from prior games that had interesting designs, and somewhat engaging mechanics, but most of all, they emotionally meant something to me. Sorry but stone cat no.6 isn't hitting me in the feels. Almost none of the bosses in this game do, and for those that do? By golly it's not even close to the older titles. To make a Fromsoft game with the tightness of design from prior series with such an open world would take years upon years, and a ballooning budget approaching Star Citizen. It cannot be done, and it absolutely shouldn't be attempted. At least if you want tightly constructed encounters with engaging thoughtful environmental storytelling, and solid boss fights with heavy emotional impact. The world is stretched too thinly....like butter...over too much bread.

Souls combat also gets stretched to its uppermost limits.....and it's not well designed. There aren't many ways to increase the difficulty of a boss in a Souls game. The route From have taken is, broadly, to add severe feints and delays to attacks, whilst increasing the frequency of them, whilst upping the quantity of AoE attacks: to understand my frustration, this isn't 'git gud'. I can route memorise bosses; I've played enough action games and Souls games to be good at that by now. The issue stems from how almost no attack animation can be trusted now. Not only does this look daft, removing gravity and inertia from many attacks and making the weapons look as if they have wildly different weights between moves, but it starts to force route memorisation where the only engagement I'm having with the boss is tedious pattern recognition. Fathom a real sword fight where a dude cartoonishly reals back a swing for three seconds, and then stabs......no. Just no. The community have collectively gaslit themselves into thinking this is acceptable after everyone lashed back at From. 

Now, with regard to AoE attacks, I'm glad they - theoretically - force the player to think about how to alternatively dodge attacks. Of course Sekiro overtly does this better, with far better telegraphing and move readability, but that's besides the point. Whilst this *is* slightly deeper, this alternative dodging mechanism is never telegraphed particularly in the game, and I can't think of a place where it's more naturally taught to the player, so I can't blame anybody with less action game experience for not considering it an option. From players that have played Sekiro might, but....it's a Souls game they'll go back to 'Roll Roll R1 Roll'. You need to break players from that habit, and the best way is teaching it: but they don't! Additionally, AoEs are chock-full of blasted particle effects which block player vision, and make the battlefield less readable. From this is an action game: telegraph attacks, and ensure attack readability. If I'm dodging things I can't see purely because of route memorisation....then sure you've succeeded at Simon-Says rather than interesting mechanically deep encounters. Though at this point I'd rather pull out my discus with four coloured buttons on it and play Simon-Says.

Then there's horse combat.....it looks silly and goofy. The camera can't keep up with it and you don't have the mechanical depth to make it engaging. And jeepers.....that one boss? I'm sorry he looks bloody ridiculous. You all know he looks bloody ridiculous. I don't care if there's an insane lore reason to justify it: it's bloody ridiculous, and makes the boss a laughing stock without an ounce of intimidation. Though....'loathsome dung eater' comes in a very close second there.

Furthermore, the horse trashes a variety of other things in Elden Ring: firstly, it ruins the open world; because you can travel faster and further than ever before, From had to ensure areas were vast open spaces which spread the content even further than before, and demanded a variety of filler content or items to fill the void. This mitigates my investment in each item, as the vast majority are throwaway items I'll be button mashing to pick up quickly as a mild distraction on my way from A to B. In prior games, I always considered why things were where they lay, and what significance they had in the world. To this day I remember finding the Ring of Great Strength in Demons' Souls, and suddenly getting a flash of inspiration for why it was there from context clues and bits of lore I pieced together in the game. It begs the player to consider the world as real and alive, and immerses them by asking them to theorise. Elden Ring doesn't....lack this, but when I'm mashing a button to pick up the vast majority of items, I don't have the investment to wonder why random sword No.3 is by this tree, nor do I care to look through such a quantity of item descriptions. In prior games you couldn't move this fast, and so it shrunk the speed of traversal, and gave you higher density, with a smaller item pool to become invested in, whereas this game incentivises me to mash to pick up random crafting ingredient no.45. The rare times this game has smaller more considered areas like the prior titles, my horse incentivises me to trivialise them, bulldosering through to grab all the items, light all the tears, and then pop off to the next area. Very few enemies can pose a threat when you utilise the horse.

Well, how about platforming with the horse? Do any of you remember Skyrim'ing up cliffs with a horse? Well, it's the same. Janky, needlessly finicky, and especially confudelling when you gave players a jump button. Don't make me jank my way down a stone brick wall on a horse, cuddling the crevices From....it's not fun or engaging, it's a hassle, and it looks downright daft, rather like the horse combat.

Then there's the bonfires....oooh the bonfires. Do you remember the heightened fear you once had as you scourerd for a bonfire in unfamiliar territory, only to feel the wash of relief as you lit it and restored your estus? That fury as you charted the best way to get to a boss for another go, or the shortcuts you could unlock to make traversal a little less arduous? Fromsoft don't...Removing the thematic relevance of a bonfire within the Souls series for a second, the bonfire, alone, is the epitomy symbol of explorers: they're the warm glowing source of refuge a weary explorer lights after a hard day, letting them relax to the spit and crackle of flames as they drift off into sleep. It keeps animals at bay around them, and grants them respite. Sites of Grace look like a bit of glowing lint on my monitor. Their design is plain, they're copiously littered throughout the world, and all I do is run from tear to tear to trivialise the world even faster than my horse can.

The game is so glaringly unfinished, unpolished, and in many cases, seemingly designed specifically to waste the player's time. Quality of life features that have been standard in every game for the last 20 years are entirely absent. Core mechanics simply do not work as intended or at all. For every brilliant game design element of this game there is another or two that are just irritating beyond words. The game offers so much to enjoy but it suffers from death by a thousand cuts.

The following is a list of issues I can recall off the top of my head at the time of writing:

The game has no brightness slider. It's an exceptionally dark game even in the daytime, and I find it very difficult to see what's going on in indoor locations if there is any ambient light in the room while I'm playing.

The map, while aesthetically beautiful, is a nightmare to interact with. The player icon is much too large and obscures nearby details. Furthermore there is no button to directly open the map, and instead you must open the menu, switch over several tabs, then hit another button before you can even begin to interact with it. That adds up to several minutes of wasted menu navigation every play session because you will need to consult the map every 30 seconds while attempting to locate anything. The game does have the standard horizontal map bar on the HUD, but it's much too small to be particularly useful on any larger display, and the icons do not include vertical indicators, which is unfortunate because your intended target is frequently an NPC somewhere inside a 3 story building. 

There is no mechanism to allow faster, larger selection of number of items when moving inventory. Trying to put 10,000 currency in a chest? Well you're going to sit there and watch it slowly tick by 100 because there's no button to move in larger increments.

You have approximately 20 armor and clothing slots in this game, which is realistic and I do appreciate, but there is no way to sort your inventory by what body part equipment belongs to. You can however sort them alphabetically, which is useful to exactly no one. If you already know what a porpoint, a cotehardie, a jupon, and a waffenrock are, then you're golden. Everyone else will spend a lot of time waffling around the inventory.

The game uses an archaic consumable-based save system. Which means you must either go through an alchemy minigame to craft your own or constantly buy more, the latter of which is cost prohibitive early game. In either case the game simply creates busy work around saving, which contributes nothing to gameplay or immersion and is not fun. Furthermore, the game has limited save slots but does not allow you to choose which file to save over when saving, instead creating a new save every time you do so. This results in needing to occasionally manually delete 50 saves in order to make room for new ones.

Several important quests in game are timed, yet the game gives you no indication this is the case, no concept of how long you might have to do them, and also will not inform you that you've exceeded the time limit until after you've completed them or attempted to turn in some step. This is one of a handful of components of the game that purists may argue is technically ""realistic"" and therefore somehow fine and forgivable, but from a gameplay perspective is simply cruel and a significant waste of the player's time and effort.

You will frequently be outnumbered in combat, sometimes very unexpectedly so, and because of the game's realistic approach to combat, that means you will quickly die with no recourse unless you find a way to cheese the AI or you manage to run away, neither of which amount to fun or satisfying gameplay.   

The devs presumably played Elder Scrolls games and were understandably turned off at how easy it was to hop and skip up steep slopes and circumnavigate intended routes. So they remedied this by going completely the opposite direction and made even the smallest pebble an insurmountable obstacle for the player character. If you ever try to engage in combat anywhere near rough terrain you WILL get caught on everything.

Many of the game's realism elements only apply to the player character. You are required to get sleep and can only use rented or owned beds to do so without the risk of being awoken and charged with trespassing or murdered by bandits. Yet many quests take the player far away from towns or inns, requiring you to waste large amounts of time riding back to a viable place to sleep while the other NPCs joining you on said quest will stand like statues all night. Additionally, many of the large towns have a law against moving at night without a torch, but many NPCs wander the streets without one. I have on two separate occasions fast traveled to a city and made an immediate beeline to my sleeping quarters only to then be awoken in the middle of the night by a guard who is charging me with walking the streets at night without a torch. While he is standing over me in my bed indoors. 

While I do not take issue with the core approach to the game's combat in the way many others apparently do, there are still elements of it that just don't work. Many of the shorter weapons will just fail to hit the opponent even when executing a perfect counterattack because they lack the reach. So you will watch a small animation of yourself parrying a blow and striking the air in front of your opponent. Also halberds flat out don't work and weren't programmed. Like, they just didn't bother to finish implementing them, so while they exist in game and can be equipped, they cannot be put away like other weapons, they can't be stowed on your horse, and they can't be sold. They're just broken.

The game is defined as an RPG, yet the skill point system is barebones and doesn't really allow for any sort of customizability or differing playstyles. You will gradually become a jack of all trades regardless of how you want to play. If you max the level of a particular skill you can generally acquire every perk, or all but one perk, with the exception of the handful of skills that are explicitly mutually exclusive. Yet none of them make an appreciable difference in gameplay outside a small number of passive combat oriented perks. Also, there are tons of unlockable weapon combos all of which are entirely useless because they require between three and five uninterrupted specific strikes to execute, and any enemy in the game who poses any sort of threat to you will be proficient enough to counter the first or second strike you make at all times. Fighting higher level enemies essentially demands that you never strike first but instead try to counter, which is a separate skill not even acquired through the leveling system.  

You will spend a lot of time just standing around waiting for things to happen. The sun rises at 5am yet in this medieval world everyone seems to adhere to modern sensibilities and sleeps in until 8 and stores don't open until even later than that. The game is effectively too dark to play when the sun is not up and the darkness lasts for a good 9 hours, yet you only ever need about 5 hours of sleep to restore your energy to maximum, so you will frequently go to sleep when the sun sets and then immediately use the wait function to pass another 4 hours after waking because there's nothing to do other than fast travel so early in the morning.
  
I feel an inexplicable compulsion to return to this game day after day yet I cannot ignore the fact that approximately 50% of my play sessions end because I am annoyed with the game and/or I've just lost half an hour of progress because the game ambushed me with 6 fully armored bandits and a dog while attempting to fast travel. Perhaps I'm some sort of secret masochist but in any case I could not truthfully tell anyone that I think this game is worth buying and playing.",1733422631,1733599461,False,175,32,0.6968889832496643,0,True,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,negative,100

This game still has probably the worst combat system ever put down in a video game ever. And not because it's ""hard"" or ""realistic"", it's neither of those things, it's just badly designed on so many levels and broken. 

You have archery and crossbows which make you a god that just murders everything without trying. Boss fights that are easier than fighting a peasant because they don't wear closed face helmets so you just stab in face. The combat system is clearly designed for 1v1 duels, but 90% of the game has you fighting groups of enemies. The combo system is convoluted and janky and just face stab is more effective 99% of the time. Enemies needing to be winded to be beat just ends up with you always on the attack when fighting groups, which winds you. And they just constantly block and dodge perfectly. 

There's just so much wrong with the combat system on a fundamental level and it's a huge part of the game, that I just can't recommend it. This is also the MOST complained about thing on the internet about this game.

I was trying very hard to enjoy this game, and I can't say it's all bad, it definitely has its moments, but it also has so many broken mechanics and bugs, and they are so annoying to deal with, that in good conscience I can not recommend this game. 

And before you dismiss me as yet another casual player, let me tell you this: I'm a history nerd, I was one of the very first bakers of this game on Kickstarter, and I was absolutely willing to make sacrifices for the sake of immersion, to live this fantasy of a medieval lay person, playing along with the game where it asks me to achieve this goal.

But I couldn't. For all the fans talk ""Don't expect Skyrim!"" this game is literally a TES clone with some ""realistic"" mechanics and pet ideas sprinkled on top, with very little attempt to innovate on the core of the Skyrim formula. It isn't nearly as immersive as the fanbase would want you to believe, despite all the official ""realism"" dogma surrounding it. A lot of mechanics seems to be frustrating for the sake of being frustrating, contributing nothing to the touted immersion. Sometimes it even feels like the game deliberately (o, heresy!) abandons realism where being realistic would make it less tedious and annoying.

For instance, when you gear breaks down, you can't fix it all in one place. Your tunic, helmet and shoes all need to be fixed by different people, which takes a lot of running around. Well, I hear you say, this is realistic, right? Cobbler shouldn't be able to fix your breastplate? Ok, but then why does my gear breaks down in like, couple in-game days? Shouldn't it last, say, an in-game month, at least? See, now this type of realism the game doesn't like, the type that makes your life easy. 

There's just so many weird decisions like this, like why doesn't the bow have a reticle? The game has no problem giving you UI, you have a dot in the middle in the exploration mode, you have 5-star hit direction indicator during melee fights, you even have a blatantly anti-medieval magic GPS map! And the bow reticle is where you draw the line? Seriously?

Saving the game takes a consumable that's limited and expensive, heavily discouraging frequent saves. And you know what, I understand the idea behind it. Don't save scam, let disasters play out, live by your choices, all the noble goals. But it simply doesn't work here! For a subtle reason: the game has to be designed around this mechanic, and this one just isn't! If things go wrong, most of the time the ONLY recourse is to reload an old save, there's almost never a plan B. You fast travel and get ambushed by unbeatable unescapable gang of bandits? Reload. You picked a wrong dialog option in a main quest and got attacked by 5 people standing around you, with your sword sheathed? Reload. You got arrested, and failed a timed quest while sitting in a jail? Reload. You barely scraped a few grosses for 1 lockpick in a scripted quest sequence and it got broken? Probably reload. Dozens of other examples. Each reload can easily put you an hour behind in progress. This is the opposite of being immersive, breaks the flow and pulls you out of the experience.

I can go on about things that just don't allow me to enjoy it. They hit me every minute, every time I try to play it. This is why it's so hard to write a short review for this game. If I try to list a few examples of things that don't work, are poorly designed or just buggy, it will sound like I'm nitpicking. Almost none of these things are a deal-breaker individually, but the sheer amount of them is a bigger problem. 

There're bugs, not just random animation glitches, but legit game braking issues that force you to reload the previous save. Inconsistent immersion-wrecking dialog options are rather common, both in side and main quests. People knowing something they really shouldn't, because you haven't told them yet, or vise versa, you having a dialog option commenting on something they haven't mentioned yet, or them repeating the same thing in different sentences as if two possible branches of the quest somehow merged together, or you completing a quest and the quest giver says something implying very different circumstances of how you picked up the quest, and so forth. The quest's logic itself is often fragile and sometimes if you stray slightly off the expected order of things, things fall apart so easily. Again, I'm struggling to list all individual issues, they're just so abundant. 

Navigating the world isn't smooth either: if you stray off trails you'll get stuck in the smallest of obstacles, bushes, tiny streams, etc. There's a lot of janky interactions between various game systems. E.g. a soldier which is part of the quest trying to arrest you, and then carrying on with their quest lines with a different voice and tone. In another quest I fought a guy, and there was a scripted scene where he cried and begged for mercy, asking not to call for guards. I spared him, and the next second accidentally pressed ""pickpocket"" on him, after which he screamed at me ""you criminal scum! guard!"".

Sometimes you may run around the city and not realize a guard wants to frisk you, you ignore him, while doing your business, only to realize a minute later there's a small army of guards now trying to legit *murder* you without even giving you a chance to explain yourself. In one city you're supposed to carry a torch at night, and if you happen to fast travel through this city and the night comes in, you may get arrested during fast travel! There's just so much absurdity like this, I didn't even scratch the surface of it, you will hit it all the time. All of that is such a massive immersion breaker. 

To be fair to the game, I also want to name a few things that kept me playing despite all of the negatives. 

Historicity. I like it. Some cities, churches, buildings are like virtual interactive museums. In-game articles on medieval history, although a bit dry, still pretty interesting. Realistically scaled world. Sprawling forests, you can get lost in and feel very remote. Pitch-black nights. Story... Some parts of it, the parts where it feels personal and true to history and societal structures of the day. I didn't mind the fact you die so easily in a group combat, this is a realism bit I can live with. The game never forced me to fight group fights in all of my playthrough. I don't mind eating and sleeping, although for some reason very few spots are available to sleep at night (e.g. you can't sleep in a barn in a haystack which are so abundant in the world and is such a natural place to crash into).

Anyway, this game has (had?) a lot of potential, but it feels like the team just didn't have enough experience to build something of this magnitude. A lot of weird game design choices and so many bugs to this day (6 years after the release!) ruined what could've been a really nice experience. Also, it feels weird to say this, but it's not the most immersive game by far that lets you live a day in a medieval world. It's just a stripped down TES clone with bunch of annoying mechanics and bugs. And it doesn't become more immersive just because you're hit with a 'hunger' debuff every 15 minutes, which you clear by double-clicking a sausage in your inventory. Nope, it's still a TES-style RPG full with the typical unrealistic conventions of the genre. It’s no more immersive than most, but it’s definitely a lot more frustrating.

The game developers and PR people truly have done a remarkable job to chalk up all the game problems to ""realism"", and present them like some sort of unique feature for a few connoisseurs who will ""understand it"". But I tell you what - time for hard truths, folks! - you don't have to be so frustrating and tedious to be immersive, realistic and true to history! You really don't.

My attempt to finish the game in preparation for the sequel highlighted the persistent issues that ruin the experience. Although I advanced further and found some enjoyment, it often felt like a chore to progress through the main story. [spoiler] The realization that the siege mission was not the final task, but another extensive fetch quest, was particularly disheartening. Similarly, the night raid mission, which I meticulously prepared for in stealth, turned out to be a predetermined sequence where stealth was not an option, undermining my efforts. [/spoiler]

The game suffers from a lackluster story and frustrating gameplay mechanics. While the narrative has interesting elements, it is frequently interrupted by tedious tasks, such as real-time following of NPCs walking, like the drawn-out walk with Sir Hans Capon to the hunting area or trailing your assistant in Pribyslavitz during construction tasks. These prolonged periods of inactivity disrupt the flow and engagement, especially when they extend beyond 5+ minutes, which is completely egregious to me, literally worse than doing nothing, following an NPC with no dialogue.

The combat system, a critical aspect of the game, is particularly unenjoyable. Victory in combat is determined more by your character's skill level than by actual player skill or strategy. Perfect parries are the key to success, making direct attacks risky and often counterproductive. This binary combat system, where you either overpower your opponents effortlessly or are doomed to fail without grinding, removes any semblance of tactical depth or player agency. Again, the absolute slog of combat of literally just standing there wanting to attack or risking it just to get perfect parried, or risking a clinch just to clip into the enemy so they beat you 68 times while you cannot resist in any way, until you eventually commit to never attacking and exclusively parrying, and then you easily win every fight without any challenge and there is now even less weight to your victories.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance excels in its ambitious scope and historical accuracy, providing a visually and contextually rich experience. However, the story's pacing, repetitive and monotonous tasks, and a flawed combat system significantly detract from the overall enjoyment.

I love the graphics, the setting, the characters, and a lot of the game systems.

But I have to say even after two attempts at playing through the game, I'm giving up again due to the combat. Now, I know you can find a TON of discussion that amounts to go practice with Captain Bernard and git gud. What is rarely mentioned is that when this game released, the play base complained so much that the combat was too easy that the devs went in and made a lot of changes to make it more difficult. This means that it is likely that you'll hit a wall of combat in some mission that will essentially be impossible to beat without going and literally training for a lengthy amount of time to just be able to use the combat system.

Now I KNOW there are people reading this review screaming 'GIT GUD! GIT GUD! GIT GUD!', and I get it.

Realistic as far as armor, weapons, clothing, etc.

BUT this cancer has the worst, most broken, mechanics I have ever witnessed.

1. COMBAT - Holy **** the auto lock is HORRENDOUS.  God have pity on your soul if you must fight more than one person at a time.  The only way to switch locked targets is moving your mouse, which is also how you choose where to swing your attacks from. Therefore you just get locked into one of your targets while the others sprint spin circles around you. Half the time as one sprints circles around you he will take that target lock and cause you to have a brain aneurysm whilst trying to even see straight without your camera attempting an uncontrollable 900 degree spin.  And once you are able to see straight without vomiting you'll click to perform a strike and Henry literally just stands there because the input registration is non existent. ""Press F to knock out (assassinate)"" lol presses F 10 times and nothing triggers except my anger issues and the combatant turning around to give away my position to the rest of the 8 guys.  As a whole, combat is the worst thing about this game, and the worst mechanical implementation of any game ever in the history of gamers gaming games.

2. GRAPHICS - meh... literally just, meh.  Character mesh clipping is worse than Skyrim mods.  Wearing a shirt with a low cut collar? Half your neck and clavicles are invisible.  Equip a hood, literally a clothing piece called a hood, nah... hood is permanently down essentially giving you a glorified scarf.  Environment from a stand-back view looks good, not great.  Look any closer to the details and you feel like you're watching a 1956 episode of Gumby.

3. MESHES / COLLISION - Realism sooo realistic that a 1 inch diameter stick prevents you from just walking.  And to make it worse, you can't even jump over it. Bushes? Impenetrable. Creeks with a knee-high bank? Try vaulting and you clip right back into the creek. A 1-foot rock, go around it because you aint walking or jumping over it.  I don't understand how a developer company could fuck up collisions so bad.

First few hours of play through you're actually impressed and immersed. Game seems really complex and deep. But few more hours in and this feeling washes away and a dread creeps in: maybe it's not complex but simply overcomplicated. The world that felt immersive at first is actually really static. It became apparent that the combat system is not that deep but simply hard, due to unintuitive controls and lack of proper feedback. And archery.., oh man, it's truly ""realistic"". 

It feels like it was a design decision to waste your time in many places. Alchemy is ""cool"" for first few tries. But hell if I'm going to waster half an hour just to make 10 potions. And then there's wait/sleep where the last hour ticks like 10 times slower on purpose. Why? And in order to do actions that you are expected to perform regularly, like ordering a bed in an inn you're forced to waste half a minute of dialogue. All those unnecessary animations. Yeah, there's Esc button, which makes this game an Esc button bashing simulator at times.

Then there are random encounters that you can't avoid. Moreover, maybe it's a bug but there are places where you get ambushed, kill all bandits, run a hundred meters ahead, get back just to be ambushed again. And this repeats constantly. Or moving down a road, forgetting something, turning around, running ten meters and bam! an ambush with a tree blocking a road that wasn't there just a minute ago. 

Most missions force you to run around the map along the same, exact static world. Yeah, there is a fast travel system. Only it wastes literally half a day on a trip that yo make in 30min of game world time. With an additional bonus: you can't avoid ambushes when fast travelling. While on a horse you can travel manually avoiding roads and never risking getting jumped by bandits.

Aaah, nights. Nights are make so dark on purpose that you're literally unable to travel even along the roads. It's as if in the middle ages the moon wasn't invented yet and people never travelled after sunset. Better yet, bandits have some perfect night vision and able to simply track you by smell.

The save system is actually cool. I would like it, however the everything said above makes it a chore. Did something important, got some good loot? Run for a bed immediately, simply to save the progress. Because at any corner you can be ambushed by two guys: one in front of you, blocking and one behind you bashing the hell out of you.

It took me 4 hours to make it out of the prologue due to both unknowingly making choices that prevented me from progressing (causing me to have to load an old save) or misunderstanding the game mechanics (e.g. giving a trader more money instead of haggling for a reduced price because the trading interface is not very clear). The small amount of combat I was finally able to experience was super clunky as my camera kept getting dragged around into angles that meant I couldn't see the attacks coming at me. The AI also seemed to be able to grab and hit me with unblockable attack animations and it wasn't explained how I could avoid or block these. 

Personally found the dialog pretty bad, some of the conversations I had with characters at the start of the game just went on and on without really touching on anything interesting and a couple times the text prompts did not accurately portray what the character actually says, leading to situations where I lost reputation or started fights I could not win due to choosing a prompt that I thought made sense. 

In terms of realism and immersion it seems pretty authentic, but I've found the game more frustrating than enjoyable so far.

Edit: Added some more below after playing another 8 hours

After playing some more, there is a more in-depth combat tutorial further into the game however even then some of the more complex techniques such as master strikes (unblockable counterattacks) are not explained well and the AI can perform them perfectly very frequently. All of the combat training also focuses purely on 1v1 combat, which is almost never the case in an actual fight since you can run into heavily armed bandits in groups of 3+ not even a short walk from the starting area. Since the combat has you locked onto a single target, the enemy you are locked onto simply has to walk slightly to one side and now your back is to the other two enemies who will tear you to shreds. In some cases I couldn't even flee either as my horse seemed to instantly get spooked and buck me off or they would somehow pull me off my horse while riding past them at full gallop.

The dialog picked up a bit a little bit later into the story which is what has kept me playing so far, but what started to annoy me was that there is very little choice in what the main character says or does. e.g. When arriving at a new town I made sure to choose dialog prompts that were respectful and tried to be kind to those who generously helped me, then (minor spoilers) [spoiler] the game forces you into a cutscene where you start a fight with the local lord[/spoiler]. This just seemed completely out of character based on all the previous dialog I had selected and at that point I really just stopped caring about what dialog I chose because I realised it wouldn't matter.

Finally, the game encourages you to think outside the box and use common sense to solve problems except this only seems to apply when they want it to. For example, at one point I had a quest where I had to rescue someone who was captured. I scouted the camp and saw that there were two heavily armed soldiers there and I (at the time an untrained blacksmith with shoddy broken equipment) thought that I would stand no chance against them. So I tried to go to the friendly castle a short walk away to get help but the quest failed since I left the area. So I fought them and beat them easily, which gave me confidence to take on riskier fights. Shortly after, I came to another quest where I had to take out two bandits hiding in the forest. I thought that would be a cakewalk compared to the previous quest, so I took them on and failed like 6 or 7 times before giving up (especially frustrating with the games limited saving system). Then by chance I was talking to the guard captain who was back at another town about a different quest and had the option to ask him for help to take out the bandits. :/

TLDR: The combat is decent in 1v1 but painfully bad in 1vX, most of the dialog only gives you the illusion of choice and does little to change the story or your character and many quests are railroaded with few alternative solutions which can be frustrating if you get stuck repeating the same quest over and over trying to complete it.",1718439952,1718618243,False,88,19,0.5967463254928588,0,True,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,negative,100

The rest of the game is fantastic but you will not be able to get around how awful the combat it.
Imagine taking Mount and Blade Warband, a game that is 11 years older than this game and using that same combat system of directional attacks and blocks... and then making it worse in every conceivable way.

The combat is rigid and contrived it is not free flowing like mount and blade, chivalry, war of the roses, mordhau, etc.
When you enter combat(and yes there is a distinct change in all your characters movements and actions in combat), you are locked onto an opponent and you rotate with them no matter how you or they move.
THIS IS FORCED AND CAN NOT BE DISABLED.
It takes real effort to swing your mouse away to turn away from an opponent to move away from them.
When you fight more than one opponent which will be frequent, the computer player will exploit this to rotate you away from the other opponent so that they are always behind you and you can not defend yourself.

The combat is basically a series of QUICK TIME EVENTS (no that's not a joke) when you swing an attack and wish to change it's direction at the last moment or wish to perform follow up attacks you don't just swing in succession, you have to click the mouse button EXACTLY when the game arbitrarily wants you to.
If you don't even though it may feel like you attacked correctly, your guy just stands there staring at the enemy and not attacking, like you didn't win the quick time event and now you're not allowed to attack.

When you defend an attack you get another quick time event, and you most only block at this specific arbitrary moment.
You can't just raise your shield or weapon even though would make all the sense in the world, if you do this then you are punished for it.
When you try to attack someone with a combo and he succeeds his quick time event, he does a super special magic block that stops your attack and freezes you weapon hand(seriously the game absolutely will not let you attack during this time).
However if he attacks you and god forbid you fail your quick time event then he will combo 3-6 attacks, and even if they all hit your shield they will all drain stamina then stagger you then you will die.
You saw an attack late because the camera is awful and so you block but not when the game wanted you to?
Then you are going to block the attack but you'll take huge stamina damage, this is the same if you were TOO QUICK and raised your shield ahead of the attack... you're punished for being too good.

This is one of those games where everything uses stamina and yet you never ever have enough of it.
You need stamina to run, to jump, to swing your weapon, to block if you didn't win the quick time event, and you lose stamina when you get hit as well!!
If you run out of stamina and you block a hit but you don't win the quick time event and block exactly when the game wants you to then you are staggered, then the enemy basically gets a free hit on you.
When you run out of stamina then you can not attack, you can not defend yourself and you can not run away... you can't do anything, you just wait for death and then the inevitable reload back a couple of hours because you can't save out in the world.
As a result you are stunlocked to death regularly and it is no less frustrating in this game as it is in any other game that does it.

At some point your armour and skills will be high enough and good enough where you may fight two enemies at once, so long as one of them isn't a dog.
Oh my god dogs... they way they are implemented into combat in this game will have you pulling your hair out.
What is scarier? a man in full plate with a large axe and steel shield, or a scrappy little hound that looks malnourished!
You're wrong it's the damn dog, they will stun lock you almost completely alone, but in pairs or with a man fighting you it's a death sentence.
They grab your arm and drain your stamina until it's gone and i click the mouse button until ive split my mouse in two, my guy just won't attack.
It doesn't matter anyway because you are forced to camera lock and the system was clearly only made to fight man sized targets you can't even hit them unless they're close, but if they're close they will automatically enter a grapple with you and drain your stamina.
Remember with no stamina you can't fight back and you can't run away...

Oh and you're stamina is tied to your health because we needed another way to reduce this absolutely critical stat even more.
If you have 50% health then your stamina bar is also capped to 50%.
So you can't fight back you can't defend yourself you can't run away and the more you're hit the worse it gets, oh and your blind as well... didn't i mention that? when you are low on stamina the screen goes dark.

There's no point talking about anything else, the game is fantastic until you get into a fight then it is the worst combat game i have ever had the misfortune of playing in my 40 years of life.

If you go online for help you will find lots of it, but it all boils down to three main points.

1. Avoid combat, the stealth in the game is actually quite good and you can one button kill enemies with skills that you can get early on, so do that until there's only one guy left then try to enjoy a fight with him.

2. Cheese it, there are many mechanics that can be exploited to get a lucky hit in, many people on forums talk about exploit the clinch(grappling) to get a guaranteed hit in. I myself have noticed that if you constantly walk backwards and make space sometimes the enemy will run on to you and when they enter the run animation they can't defend themselves. Getting them to vault over something in front of you like a stool also works.
Any enemy you you haven't locked onto will never defend your strikes, it's like he can't see them coming if you're not locked on. So getting a non locked enemy to pass between you and a locked enemy then attacking will work but is very unreliable, it's just proof of concept.

3. Brute Force, When your armour and weapon and skills and stats get so high you can just brute force your way through the combat. I already have the armour that will resist most bladed weapons and they basically don't hurt me so i can get hit to deliver a big hit from my Heavy Warhammer.

All of those methods though show how bad the combat is because they all avoid getting stuck in and actually using the combat system.
Even when you do it is deeply unsatisfying.
Every time i win a fight against a strong opponent i come away feeling i was lucky rather than i did well.
When i actually manage to hit a tough opponent it feels like it's because the computer let me hit him.
This is a terrible feeling and is not at all enjoyable or entertaining which is the reason we play video games in the first place.

I absolutely can NOT recommend this game!

KCD is undoubtedly one of the buggiest single player open world games I’ve played so far but I think there’s a good and bad thing there. It really seemed like Warhorse studios needed a little bit more time to cook and the game would’ve been amazing, unfortunately many of the flaws are steadily apparent for a game like this and I think some of these flaws are so bad that it’ll turn people off completely. 

The game can be tedious. There are a lot of things in the game and the systems seem somewhat relatively fleshed out. Henry can’t read, Henry can’t fight. He doesn’t really do anything until you go seek proper guidance to learn and then make your way into the world. Saviour Schnapps, an ingame item that allows Henry to quicksave is a good addition but for how buggy the game is, is unfortunately a loss to me. 

The game unfortunately doesn’t incentivize players to progress up until a certain point and that means you’ll likely need to finish a bit of the main quests so that you can really get a-hold of your place in the world. Moving from Skalitz into Rattay into Neuhof is really where freedom begins as well as obtaining your first horse. You should also note that training with Captain Bernard is also the bare minimum to even learn how to do other combat moves in the game. From a personal standpoint I find that to be a big flaw since I tried moving past that only to find it extremely frustrating to see enemies be able to riposte and never be able to figure out why I couldn’t do the same 30 hours in.

The dice game is actually quite fun once you get the hang of it. The explanation for the game to some people doesn’t make sense because they overcomplicate things but it’s actually not bad. The only other thing is that it requires some experience beforehand but otherwise it’s quite intuitive and buying additional dice to use as your own as an upgrade is interesting. The game is good enough that I feel that it would actually warrant a decent dice tavern game for a D&D game. 

The game itself requires your full attention foremost. So within the AAA space I would say that this is definitely one of those games which can be very annoying.as the game requires you to read (big shock) and listen to dialogue. I do think however that this can be highly inaccessible to many folks who are more casual gamers as sometimes clues to quests are merely said in dialogue once and they never say it again. The good thing is that you can complete quests in whichever way you wish so there are a multitude of ways to do something. The bad thing is that since the game is so in depth with certain ways NPCs work with day/night cycles and daily schedules to pathing, when something breaks, which is quite frequent it feels absolutely horrible. However, when the game does work together it’s absolutely magical. 

One of the worst things in the game has to be the fact that combat is so janky. One on one combat is usually fine in itself but when you’re surrounded, your only way to overcome many fights is with the bow which is one of the most broken weapons in the game if you can aim, and use potions. The potions in this game make it an absolute breeze so it’s incentivized that you learn how to read, learn how to brew potions and try your best to speedrun level 10 potions for autobrew. 

The other thing is stealth. There are a multitude of instances where stealth as a mechanic is utilized but it’s not entirely explained or utilized correctly. Places are way too bright which can likely reveal you, utilizing armor sets that reduce your noise and visibility is okay but man, it’s so ass when it’s a non-existent option when you’re likely to be noticed unless a quest designates and programs npcs for a free stealth kill. 

It feels extremely hopeless to be tossed around like a bowling pin by a ton of bandits wailing on you as your stamina bar disappears even with maxed traits. The story of this game is okay at best. While it’s your standard hero's journey of Henry of Skalitz making his way in the world, Henry/Hal is extremely dumb in the game and so playing Hal and being Hal in a cutscene feels in many cases disjointed as players are likely to be bandits that rob, steal and kill for groshen.
The game itself has a ton of content hence that 100 hour mark and even after I was done, there was still content I likely missed. However, not all the content was good. There were a lot of times that quests were simply broken or main quests were connected to certain side quests and so they were mandatory to main quest progression. 

An example of content that I personally skipped was a huntsman telling me to capture nightingales in the forest where I had to drop baskets. The baskets would disappear never to be picked up when I dropped them and I had to search up the quests to figure out how to place the baskets. That quest is an absolute nightmare. I didn’t even choose to finish because of the menial rewards and absolute pain it is to finish. A short hand is to just look it up on the wiki if you’re unsure. 

I do think that the DLC was okay, I think Woman’s Lot should have a pre-message that you’ll be going into a cutscene or notice that you have to finish the entire thing to get back to Hal. The treasure map DLC is ass, it’s such a pain to find the treasure that it’s not worth doing as even though it’s free loot and a huge upgrade on gear sets early on, I wouldn’t use it unless I was desperate. The Hans Capon quest was a nice little touch but imagining that coming out and paying full price? That’s a stretch to me I think. Out of all the DLC the best ones are probably Band of Bastards, and From the Ashes.

You get so much gold by the mid to late game that you’re not exactly struggling as much as before when it came to economy. The From The Ashes DLC allows players to claim Privislavitz as a fief under the supervision of Sir Divish and it’s a great sink and healthy for players to prevent having too much gold. By the end of the game I had 97,000 Groschen just as an example of how much gold players would get by mid to late game if they didn’t spend it. 

When the game finishes, you’re kind of left going “that’s it?” And it’s one of the reasons that prompts that 2nd game as the next installment. I really think that this could be a dream game to some people if it were possible to have it be like a Mount & Blade situation but then the details of the game were similar and much more polished on the interior parts likewise to this game.

Nearly every gameplay mechanic also felt janky and unpolished.

The combat is absolutely atrocious. Not because the system is bad, I think they can pull it off well, but when you get to a high level Henry who is a beast at swordfighting, and you get master parried by a peasant of all people, is just frustrating. And this will happen a LOT. The combat basically becomes a borefest where you just spam master parry yourself because that's just the optimal way to play, and playing any other way will get you killed in combat. Good luck trying to attempt combos most of the time. Fortunately, it seems devs have recognized this, and will allow for more aggressive combat in KCD2.
On a good note, it will really immerse you in its environment, and I loved the side content, like alchemy for example.

1. Save function. You save your game by sleeping or drinking a Saviour Schnapps potion. You can sleep at designated sleeping areas such as your home, Inns and Campsites. I understand this function was designed to prevent players from repeatedly saving and loading games to avoid certain outcomes, but even after 6 years this game still has plenty of bugs and crashes. It's truly pathetic when you lose progress to a glitch all because your game enters into the infinite loading screen bug. I would like to see an auto-save function after key interactions, like trading transactions or bathing services.

2. Tutorial. The tutorial is somewhat thorough, but also incredibly vague in some areas. As soon as I learned I could lockpick chests, pickpocket, or knockout sleeping denizens and rob them of their valuables - I did just that. To keep things short, engaging in any of these activities regardless of stealth status results in a hefty fine or jail time. It's also not like I can just load my saved game and revert my curiosity because of the limited save function unless I want to repeat the last 30 minutes. 

3. Combat. It's horrible. I absolutely abhor swordplay and archery in KC:D. Combat feels extremely sluggish and the lock-on system still needs polish. I'm unsure if it's just me or controller players in general, but I lose my right joystick functionality because the target lock-on system aim assist is too powerful. I am unable to switch between targets and running away isn't an option when my view continually snaps back to the bandit. Look, I get it. It's historically accurate for the time period. That's fantastic; keep falling back on those flimsy excuses. It makes no sense a bandit decked out in full metal armor and a shield can keep pace with me as I'm running to find an advantage. 

4. Collision. Every NPC has a 2 foot bubble around them. I've been stuck in a house because an NPC/dog is blocking the doorway. Towns also have extremely narrow passageways with guards walking on an invisible treadmill. Slightly brushing past a small bush brings you a full halt when horse riding. 

5. Reputation. For a game that strives for realism and historical accuracy, I'm surprised at the current Reputation system. I can steal, pickpocket, and knock people out in stealth with no witnesses in the middle of the night and still lose Reputation for a fiefdom. Other reviews have defended this by claiming there would be obvious suspicion of a new arrival in a fiefdom following the disappearance of personal items. Yeah, maybe. It all seems too circumstantial and breaks immersion for me. It just sounds like a terrible excuse for a truly broken system and requires major tuning. 

6. Quests. Kingdom Come: Deliverance has an abundance of fetch quests. It's a lot easier to understand how players have hundreds of hours logged after completing a few of these main/side quests. Also, there are so many 'follow me' quests - As in, please follow me as we walk around the entire fiefdom at half speed. KC:D is a game with a strong narrative, where its story-telling is rooted in history. That's really neat, but aside from the towns, the open world feels very dead. There are occasional bandit encounters and accidents, but not much else. With most quests it felt like I was just traveling miles to talk to 1 person before returning. 

I didn't expect the entire story to be told through cinematic cut-scenes or character's lip movements to be misaligned with their speech. It's like I'm just watching a poorly dubbed European film.

I did expect the game to have a bit more free roam, but it seems most skills and features are elaborated through the main story progression. I'd like to explore more on my own and put the story aside for later, but it seems like a waste of time without a mount (main story quest reward). 

I did enjoy my playthough. The open world is visually stunning, even down to the finer details like how the morning sun shines through tree branches. All things considered, there's a ton of available activities. However, I wasn't thrilled about having to forgo certain criminal acts to avoid losing reputation. Ultimately, I think the game being in first person was the final nail. The camera shaking during mount transportation and combat just felt dizzying. I believe most people who praise this game use plenty of mods to improve their combat and performance experience. I'd rather just wait for the Witcher 4.

If you are looking for medieval serf simulator, this is it. Many aspects of serf life come to pass. You're useless at everything, especially combat. It appears to be designed for VR or something, because it doesn't work smooth with neither a controller nor a keyboard. All you're good for is mule labor, but your character is also very weak. If you wear armor, carrying small things will overencumber you very fast. Everything is a chore. You'll be doing things like picking weeds and getting berated for ""doing a poor job"" even though there's no more weeds left because the guy wants to scam you. Your character is very low IQ and uncoordinated, but also some kind of languages savant that learns how to read his own language but also Latin in a day. The travel system is really awful, just like it really was in those times. There's a hunger system, but you don't have to drink or use the toilet. There's little bits of ""realism"" sprinkled about everywhere, but it's really inconsistent.

All in all the game has too many anti-fun elements. Devs should definitely play something like Mount & Blade and stay away from the quick time events type combat.

Story 9/10, compelling story about revenge and survival
Combat 1/10, it's annoying and gets in the way. It's not difficult, it's just annoying and doesn't work smoothly.
Gameplay 1/10, lockpicking is somewhat acceptable but annoying. Pickpocketing is extremely annoying. Doing quests where you have to carry anything is torture due to Henry being too weak to wear armor before you level strength, but without armor everything kills you immediately. You get a dog companion, but you have to level it up by feeding it 300 times and you get the same cutscene every time you do this. The dog does not have a cooldown on feeding him, it just takes about 6 seconds to do so every time as you can only feed 1 item at a time. WHY? Devs just went out of their way to make it a bumpy ride. Don't even bother with archery, Henry is always drunk with a bow in his hands.

Kingdom Come Deliverance is a game I’ve enjoyed and spent a significant amount of time playing. However, despite my experience with it, recommending this game would not be entirely fair. The game suffers from a large number of technical issues, to the point where I would almost describe it as a ""bug fest.""

The problems range from a clunky horse-riding mechanic—worse than even Skyrim's—to flawed dialogue interactions where subtitles often don’t match the actual conversations, sometimes pulling text from entirely different scenes.

The save system is notably weak, with tagged saves that have caused me to lose hours of progress, forcing me to replay large sections of the game.

One of the most glaring flaws is the combat system. It stands out as one of the worst I’ve seen in a video game, particularly because it contradicts the overall gameplay experience. The combat works only in 1v1 scenarios, but the game frequently throws you into situations where you're fighting multiple enemies, which the mechanics simply cannot handle. The system is not designed to accommodate combat against more than one opponent, making encounters unnecessarily frustrating and tedious.

Beyond these significant technical issues, the game does have an engaging and interesting story with some great twists, as well as a decent level of customization. It sets the foundation for a game that could become something exceptional. However, for any potential sequel, the combat system would need a complete overhaul, starting from scratch, with more dynamic gameplay and more varied missions. Additionally, significant improvements are needed to bring the game up to acceptable technical standards.

[i] So, yes, I would still recommend you play Kingdom Come Deliverance. I believe, or at least hope, that a future sequel will resolve these issues and turn it into an outstanding game. That being said, I cannot leave a positive review at this time. The volume and severity of the problems—especially those tied to the save system—are too critical. [/i]

I love the lore. I love some elements like the menu UI. I love the world, I like many of the characters, and dialog options too, so the RPG elements are on point.

I cannot recommend the game, because I dislike most of the rest. It is like the makers had two different ideas when making the game: A fun medieval open world game, and a medieval realistic simulator. Many gameplay systems reflect it.

There is an alchemy system, basically you make potions. Doesn't fit the realistic simulator aspect at all. The mini game for it, is very fantasy like with you using containers that magically auto refill, and they have borderline magical effects. It is super FUN!

Then there are things like the combat or even worse, archery. Because you are a peasant, but one who was born useless, as if you somehow matured from baby to man in a week, with no life skills, you cannot wield a bow. In other words, you cannot hit ANYTHING. Like, the lower level you are (which means pretty much dozens of hours at the start of the game) all you can do is maybe sorta shoot 5 arrows to hit a target once, that is just a bit further from you. There is no reason why you can have magical alchemy that just happens, but not magical archery that just happens. You can't really call it skill based either. It is deliberately janky to make it a ""true simulation"", as if shooting with a mouse and keyboard is somehow realistic and can feel the same, or that the on purpose janky mechanics somehow realistically emulate true archery.

There is a level of love for this obviously bad game play in the community it seems, comparing it to souls like games. I can't really agree to it, but I suppose some people just love for their games to feel like work to spend hunders of hours on. If you aren't into that, maybe steer away. If you are into it... maybe pick something more polished, like the previously mentioned souls like games.

But at the end of the day, my biggest issue is that the game does not respect the players type. You know those quests where you get one but all you are doing is walking forward to get to point A, click interact twice and go back, and that takes like 10 minutes? Yeah, I had those... many many times. The quest points are in fact set almost deliberately far away to make the content ""longer"".

So no, I can't recommend the game. I think it has some great elements. The writing, the creativity, the world building, but the gameplay and time wasting quest design is off putting, I can't help but regret ever playing it, despite having found a few hours of fun in it.",1725473123,1725473123,False,8,0,0.5139890313148499,0,True,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,negative,100

I bought it for $3 and I am not going to continue playing the game because of the dumb and frustrating game mechanics. 

1) There are still a lot of bugs and glitches with the game after 6 years, including main quest issues, character inconsistencies, etc.

2) The combat in the game makes the the game unbearable. Yes it has a cool idea, but the issue lies with ""master strikes"" and parries. Meaning there is no point to actually attacking anyone in the game because the likelihood is that you'll be hit with a  ""master strike"" which is an unblockable attack from the AI and theres nothing you can do about it. There are also combos that the AI will randomly throw at you which sometimes you are not able to parry or block it for some reason. This only drags combat out for 10 minutes at a time for no reason. The AI also tends to parry or dodge every 2-3 swings you throw at them so you can't even hit a combo skill that the game offers. Not to mention if you're involved in a 1v2 or more situation then it is basically a death sentence.

3) Fast travel, can't save the game whenever, time consuming. The game is plagued by this back and forth between towns which is fine, but the issue lies with fast traveling. When you fast travel theres a chance a random event could happen where you are ambushed. This results in a coin toss of whether or not you ""avoid"" it or not. If you fail then you're thrusted into a 3v1 situation which means instant death. So fast traveling is not the best and now you're forced to travel without which takes even more time. Also, you can't save the game unless you sleep or have a consumable item in the game which is extremely inconvenient.

Point of the matter is, the game has a good RPG foundation but everything else is terrible and makes the game unbearable.

Sadly, what looked like a groundbreaking RPG with its emphasis on historical accuracy and complex systems quickly became a bit of a letdown.

Let’s start with the positives, because there are a few. The game’s setting is genuinely impressive. The medieval Bohemia feels alive with its detailed landscapes and historically grounded design. The developers clearly poured a lot of effort into making the world look and feel authentic, which is cool if you’re into historical accuracy.

But here’s the kicker: after a while, the shine wears off. The main issue with Kingdom Come: Deliverance is that it quickly turns into a tedious grind. The game throws you into this massive open world with what often feels like a million tiny tasks and side quests, but good luck figuring out what’s actually important. Objectives can be vague and the story doesn’t do much to keep you hooked. You might find yourself wandering around, wondering what you’re supposed to be doing next, and frankly, it can be boring.

The combat system also falls flat. It’s supposed to be this intricate and realistic melee system, but in practice, it feels clunky and awkward. Fights can drag on, and the lack of fluidity makes them more frustrating than exciting. And don’t even get me started on the bugs. Yes, patches have fixed some, but encountering issues that break immersion isn’t uncommon.

The character interactions are another letdown. NPCs often seem stiff and lack depth, making it hard to get invested in the story or care about the people you’re interacting with. Dialogue choices feel shallow and don’t really impact the game in a meaningful way.

In short, Kingdom Come: Deliverance feels like it bit off more than it could chew. The ambition is commendable, but the execution is lacking. If you’re after a richly immersive medieval RPG, you might want to look elsewhere.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
[list]
[*]Combat is atrociously janky and clunky; often the attack buttons & dog commands are unresponsive, making combat unnaturally sluggish. 

[*]The 5 attack direction reminds me of For Honor's 3 stances, in which it is just as unrewarding to use against AI opponents who can block mostly everything without rhyme or reason; At least in For Honor you get the full complement of combos, parries, feints and whatnot to keep it interesting, KC:D is stripped and simplified of anything at the start (you can learn combos and other stuff sometime later, but if the combat is bad for the first few hours, that’s the game’s fault, not the player’s responsibility to stick through). 

[*]Even after you get to learn the more advanced combat mechanic it does not improve by much. A good combat system have predictability, and rewards those who understand patterns and react properly. KC:D’s combat is pretty random, you can swing at enemies and it’s a crapshoot whether it lands, get blocked, or countered. 

 [*]Combo system is pretty shit, using the mouse to string multiple directional attacks don’t feel particularly good, and even if you’re good at it, it’s generally not a good idea to string multiple attacks together due to random block & counter potentials.

[*] Defending is mostly just spamming the guard button and hoping one of them is timed to the perfect guard (which causes an auto-counter). The dodging mechanic isn’t worth it because if you miss the perfect guard you can still block the attack; whereas if you miss the perfect dodge, you’re standing still and getting a lobotomy. I think they also share the same window to proc, so they'e mutually exclusive and there's no need to get good at both.

[*] The camera’s auto-lock is annoying, moving the mouse too far for attack directions causes you to accidentally disengage the lock on and probably get stabbed in the side, which is a bit of a bad design when they already give you a specific button to intentionally disengage.

[*]The stamina system kills pacing of fights a bit as you back away periodically to restore it. So you strafe around for several seconds while the enemy walks towards you menacingly, probably without attacking. If they do attack, it means you need several more seconds of strafing around because blocking attacks also drains stamina.

[*] Archery is @ss, the game feels the need to give you a dot reticle when you’re not using the bow and taking it away when you are, so you’re incentivized to stick something to your screen as a replacement reticle.

[*]Overall, combat fails in being 1) realistic (people who think it is have lost grasp of reality) 2) rewarding to learn its complexity (it's as deep as a puddle) & for skillful play. and most importantly 3) fun.

[h1]Other complaints[/h1]
[list]
[*]Quests are sometimes time-wasting, making you walk slowly from point A to point B which are needlessly far apart from each other because the world is designed to look expansive and pretty rather than being actually fun to play in as a game. (looking at you, Woman’s Lot DLC)

[*]Stealth (& stealth kills) mechanics in this game are terrible, there's a reason most competently made stealth games gives AI predictable movement patterns and view cones. Unpredictability of AI movement also makes lockpicking and stealing a bit of a crapshoot rather than a strategically timed activity.

[*] The save system leads to time-wasting, just let players save and load freely like every other game instead of spending in-game money to buy or spending time herb picking and crafting schapps. it just makes the game more tedious if they have to reload to an autosave that's 0.5-2h ago.

The person who worked on the story deserves all the praise, the one who did the dialogues deserves all the praise, the artists did an amazing job, the visuals are just heavenly. The work on the map, the outfits, the weapons, it’s all just top-notch. I won’t even mention the small stuff like the dog constantly getting in your way or the horse appearing out of nowhere. Lots of games have these quirks and it’s not a big deal. But YOU! The one who designed the combat system, you’re gonna burn in hell. Literally. Everyone who has played this game curses you out in combat, and it’s totally deserved. Let me try to explain why.

You wanted to go for realism, right? Okay, tell me this: if you’re fighting two guys and one flanks you, but you’re swinging your sword at the one in front of you, would your arm continue the swing even if the other guy is whacking you on the head with a club? Or would you stop and look to see what the other guy is doing? I think the answer is obvious. So why the hell does the character keep turning and spinning around when I want to focus on one enemy? You completely ruined the combat system. When you get surrounded by a bunch of bandits near the mill, the player can’t do anything because the character is just uncontrollable. Do you get it? YOUR COMBAT SYSTEM MADE THE CHARACTER UNCONTROLLABLE. The player loses control at the most crucial moment, during combat!

In these 32 hours of gameplay, I’ve had so much frustration and I’ve been enraged multiple times, literally to the point where I smashed my expensive mouse. I have a question for you, the one who designed this combat system: have you ever actually used it, tested it? Have you played this game yourself? I’m out of patience with you, idiot. Burn in hell.

There are SO MANY bugs that it frequently is a PAIN to play it. And I don't want to support dev teams that don't fix their bugs. Period.

- ""wanted"" status (with no additional details) appearing at random (yeah, at random, like after a fast travel or after a night in a bed), sometimes leading to guards arresting you and telling you ""I'm keeping that stuff"", although you didn't have ANYTHING stolen in your inventory...
- caught in the act by God knows whom... There is NO ONE in the area, but I am still ""caught in the act""...
- enemies head-shotting me at 150 meters in the dark, with no torches, during the night, and my stealth at top level + bonus for crouching + stealthy outfit, whereas I can barely see them even with a ""nighthawk"" potion
- enemies turning towards me when I'm crouching, but they ""did not see me"", yeah yeah... reminds me of Blood Money
- enemies who could hear/see me when I am at sound=0 and stealth++ (potion) during the night and crouching with all bonuses in the Stealth skill... and I lost SO MANY hours of gameplay because of these bugs... and SO MUCH frustration!!!!
- enemies who could hear/see me put a few drops of poison in their cauldron during the night whereas no one was even watching the said cauldron (I seriously don't know how it could be possible to do what was asked in a stealth way, without having to waste every single bandit first...)
- 70% of HP lost because my horse rode... I don't know at which angle of the road... I did not fall or anything, just my HP dropped all of the sudden because my horse was walking funny for a few meters
- walking ""head on the bottom and feet on top"" (the view was reversed, the sky was at the bottom) when falling from horse in a slope... had to mount the horse again to get back to normal (but until then, I could run in the prairies, with the sky at the bottom and the grass on top)
- enemies with strange movements (halberd men running towards me and turning around me like they are trying some pathfinding)
- the bow is PAINFUL to use, there is no ""assist"" like there is with melee combat, no crosshair, nothing... sometimes you can aim at a guy who is like TWO METERS away from you, who is not moving, and still miss the target somehow... also it is EXTREMELY slow to reload which makes no sense because experienced archers are actually quite fast with bows
- impossible to repair items below 60% durability even at the highest skill level
- no bedroll FFS
- guards arresting you because you don't bear a torch at night, whereas 100% of the population is NOT bearing one either
- people getting mad at you for no reason (not trespassing or anything, but somehow you are still doing something suspicious enough... go figure)
- some people can't be stolen properly of their clothes and other stuff (e.g. the Locator, of whom I wanted the nice hat)
- sometimes you get teleported to a very inconvenient place after a cutscene and/or dialogue (e.g. when stealth-discovering Runt's camp, you get teleported in front of guards after a cutscene... nice... or if caught in the act of trespassing in town, even if you run away from the place but you are caught afterwards, you get teleported back inside the ""trespassing"" area after the dialogue)
- losing health when falling down even just one meter or something (you have to pick a talent to prevent that, at least partially)
- also a VERY VERY VERY FRUSTRATING issue: bushes can't be walked through!!! and the same applies to some other places like the sides of a small stream: it is only 30cm high but you can't jump it and your horse can't either... and as for the bushes, you can get stuck in them, and if you succeed jumping above them somehow (on a horse) and there is a slope, be ready to get seriously hurt when you land
- many things don't work as expected, e.g. applying a ""sleep potion"" to your arrows is supposed to drain the enemy stamina to zero, but the guys could still run faster than me and multi-strike me with no respite
- enemies with surprisingly greater stamina than mine, even when they are wearing full plate and I'm only wearing some black pants ; also they can strike you 3 to 4 times in a row very rapidly, whereas when you want to strike, your character takes a couple of seconds to land a single lousy strike that they easily block
- some painful things, like having to follow the Locator when building things, or the freaking hunt mission with Capon that takes ages and is boring as hell because first I don't want to hunt bunnies and also how on Earth are you supposed to aim at a 20cm target with in mind what I said above about the bow (I even went to another city to do some other stuff because of how long it was)
- the bow angle is very limited when on horse, it is painful to use...
- you can't talk to people while on a horse
- from time to time I got a message ""your reputation decreased"" just while walking the streets or picking some flowers, I don't even know what happened
- having to drink alcohol to save the game makes no sense, it breaks the fun
- sometimes there are some reaaaaaaaally slow loading times when ""fast traveling"" to a city (slow like 20 to 30 seconds) ; it feels random
- some guy went into the bed of an already sleeping girl (in the bathhouse) and I don't think it was meant as a funny way of saying they were going to ""share a bed"" ; in the same manner, sometimes there are two guards in the exact same pixel-perfect position (although their animation may vary) (e.g. at the front ""door"" of Rattay)
- you can't stop a fast travel (or I didn't find out how)
- you can however stop a sleep session, but to my knowledge it prevents the save from happening
- some enemies disappearing all of a sudden, or re-spawning all of a sudden
- when a named enemy holding important information surrenders after a fight, you can't interrogate him to get the needed information, because it was not scripted that way, which makes no sense
- I am the bailif of a city, and the guards are warning me that I can't bear a weapon
- I wanted my character to be faithful to his lover, but it was apparently not scripted that way
- pickpocketing is WAY (!!) too much random: sometimes you get caught when just pressing the key (in that case I hope for your sake that you saved not too long ago), sometimes you get a full 15 seconds of ""time"", and sometimes only 3 seconds... it should clearly be more consistent, depending on the player stealth, and the state of the ""victim"" (sleeping, unaware, walking, etc.) ; because sometimes, even a sleeping vagrant caught me when I just pressed the key, which makes not much sense
- my companion guards (when attacking a bandit camp) not moving an inch because it was ""my job"" to waste some archers... so they stood still, even when getting shot at
- the UI is not quite convenient (e.g. when trying to compare armor/clothes for a specific area of the body, or when looking for a specific item, or to mark stuff as ""garbage to sell"", etc. also you can't ""store in horse"" directly when looting, which makes the process painful)
- loading a game is very painful (and I mean ""the most recent save""), it requires at least 5 keystrokes + clicks, or 8 keystrokes if only using the keyboard ; and because you are going to load a savegame quite regularly because of bugs, it makes the process painful

And I'm beginning to feel really dozy, so I'll stop there, but I'm quite sure there is more that I should/could have jotted down and written here...

The game has great potential: sure there are potions, but other than that it is somewhat realistic (which feels nice from time to time), it features beautiful scenery, interesting lore, etc. and don't misunderstand me: it is refreshing!

+ Really appreciate the writing and setting
~ Graphics are weird. Some things look cool while some are straight up ugly
- It's a bugfest
- Combat system is something different
- Worst DLC of all time (""A woman's lot"" - never try it!)
- Save system is also something I can't agree with
- Quests are turning into chores and sometimes it feels like a walking simulator
- Game is pretty difficult which wouldn't be a problem normally, but in this case it's because a lot of things are not explained, you learn by making mistakes. And also bugs can make things hard.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Mass Effect 1[/h3]
The one that began it all, and that’s a merit of its own - even with all the clunkiness and half-assed mechanics it may have. In this Legendary edition, ME1 is the oldest and, of course, has received the best uplift from its former self. The remastering work, in some fields, borders on the “remake”; the UI was completely reworked and modernized in comparison to the unwieldy, clunky disaster of the original. Everything feels smoother, more responsive, more fluid. The visual upgrades are impressive, and a far cry from the original in almost all aspects; however, this probably weighed more on its dated engine, and that’s the reason behind the sporadic crashes and frame-drops in specific areas. 

Gameplay–wise, an effort has been made to rebalance the economy, loot tables, weapons and enemy difficulty. On one side, this makes the early-to-mid game phases more challenging on higher difficulties, so much that you might get 1-shot but snipers and other shenanigans; on the other it makes late-game much more trivial compared to the original. This is mainly due to the massive power creep in both weapons and attachments, other than absurd amounts of money gained from sales, and imbalances in the XP gained from side missions, far more than it would be reasonable. Result: Shepard will become an unstoppable killing machine, capable of 1-shotting most enemies with heavier weapons and ragdoll the rest across the battlefield by sheer bullet impact force.

The controls, UI, movement and cover systems have been largely overhauled, a large improvement over the clunky mess that were the controls of the original ME1, as now they’re more similar to the far superior sequels in handling. For the rest, the game remains largely the same, including the tedious side-exploring of planets for collectibles or the time-consuming meandering through locations with dubious fast-travel solutions, if any. It’s a good RPG, but in my opinion the weakest of the trilogy gameplay-wise.

[h3]Mass Effect 2[/h3]
Considered by many, myself included, to be the overall apex of this trilogy, ME2 has undergone visible but comparatively-minor overhauls if compared to its older brother. The lighting solutions are markedly improved, same for textures and effects quality, overall offering a crispier visual fidelity, but not without downsides. The visible, annoying aliasing (jagged edges) can’t be countered very well by the shoddy anti-aliasing solution, so you’ll either have to live with it, or use GPU control panel fiddling or external mods (such as ReShade) to alleviate the problem. Moreover, roughly the same results, except for lighting, could be achieved with existing mods, like the popular “ALOT” to name one. Is the remaster version better? Yes, it is, but not without additional performance issues, especially at the Citadel.

The balance shenanigans of ME1 Remaster are fortunately gone, and the game offers a consistent, well-balanced challenge (unless you play on Insanity, which I did, and is pure pain) that you will enjoy. The story and character arcs of this second entry are the best in the trilogy; most people that aren’t my dead-inside self will become emotionally-invested in the characters and events surrounding Shepard’s space opera epic in saving the galaxy. 

Unfortunately, the devs didn’t want to alleviate the tremendous pain that is planet scanning, which will take literally dozens of hours to 100%, if you’re a completionist or, like me, an autist. Be prepared to put an anime on your second screen (if you don’t have a second screen, buy a cheap one) and scan endless planets for miserable resources and the occasional artifact collectible. You don’t have a choice anyway, if you want upgrades.

[h3]Mass Effect 3[/h3]
This last chapter is, of course, the one that benefitted less from the remaster, as it’s the most modern and, even in its original state, had pretty solid visuals. The remaster’s results are not as noticeable here. Barely any change was made to the gameplay, UI or balancing compared to the original release. Considered by many to be the worst entry of the series (except Andromeda, but we don’t speak about that one…), I don’t think it’s fair to say that, especially gameplay-wise. Sure, the story is a downgrade from ME2 and the ending a train wreck, but it has its great moments; its gameplay is hands down the best in the trilogy, by variety of weapons, builds, combat feel and mechanics. It’s still better than Mass Effect 1 as far as I’m concerned, and having played this trilogy four times in my life, I can tell.

It’s downright a shame that the fun, engaging, varied multiplayer of ME3 was mercilessly scrubbed away. It may have been infested by dumb microtransactions, it may not have been well-balanced, but with some friends or even randoms it was a blast, and had plenty of content not available in the main game, like being able to play as enemy characters with unique abilities, unlocking unique weapons, and even unique enemies like “upgraded” Collectors.",1705809340,1705809340,True,235,4,0.9425537586212158,11,True,False,False,False,1328670,20250114_132033,positive,100

Filled with amazing imagery, solid writing / voice acting and immersive gameplay that really makes you feel like a badass flying through space saving the galaxy. For me it feels a bit like a spiritual successor to the Knights of the Old Republic games in many ways, tying space sim elements to a story-deep action RPG. As the series progresses, so does the quality of life changes and positive changes to some of the weaker elements of the first game. Visually, the whole thing is stunning and still manages to hold up today - though I would recommend installing a couple of mods just to make your experience that much greater. I used the ALOT and ALOV mods which feature upscaled textures and videos. 

For those completely new to the series, essentially this is a third person action RPG, using a cover system. The game tends to split between exploration, gunplay and the story-driven narrative, employing a morality system that lets you determine what kind of galactic saviour you are. You might be a paragon of hope, making decisions to be kind and benevolent, or a renegade who takes any action available to them to get the job done. Of course, many difficult decisions are present in this series, ones that will certainly carry over even from the first game to the third. That renegade decision might ultimately be the right move for example - or it might just be funny or cool! 

The first game of this series released in 2007 - and it mostly holds up very well. That said, some of the controls and gunplay feel a little restrictive, and I would have liked to see more features such as FOV control or shoulder cam switching. That said, the second game vastly improves on the shooting elements. The other thing I feel I should mention is the awful EA launcher that tries forcing you to launch after you install. I highly recommend looking up the 'F@@@ EA guide' which gives you a very useful way of avoiding it altogether. Of course, there was some controversy with how the last game ended back in the day, and this ended up with a lot of drama unfortunately. Without giving too many spoilers regarding that, I'll just say the ending felt quite rushed. There are a lot of mods and a patch that Bioware released, though I never tried it myself as this is the first time I've replayed the series since completing it all those years ago. 

On a final note, as anyone who is a fan of Star Trek or similar, RPGs or Sci-Fi stories, this collection is a must-have, and probably for me one of the best game series of all time.

[b]Recommended mods:[/b]
For the entire trilogy, I recommend ALOT (Texture improvements), ALOV (AI upscaled videos) and Lighting Restoration. These mods are available for each game as packs and make a lot of improvements that bring the ME series almost to the current gen in a lot of ways. 

To vastly improve the ending of ME3, I highly, highly recommend getting CEM (Citadel Epilogue Mod). This basically places one of ME3s DLCs at the end of the game, which basically acts as a heart warming goodbye to all the characters in the game. It just fits so well, especially since the DLC contrasted with the grim narrative of the final game.

Lastly, for ME3, make sure to get EGM (Expanded Galaxy Mod). This adds a huge bunch of new quests and truly difficult decisions that effect your final army for the last fight, in a totally meaningful way. It adds so much more immersion to the game - I mean a LOT. The maker of the mod deserves so much credit. There is one scene that allows you to call in the final battle near the end of the game that is genuinely one of the most kino moments in gaming I've experienced.

I played the previous games in their original PC versions, and I’d say they did a fantastic job polishing this final release, adding newer features like Ultrawide support, HDR, and controller compatibility. However, to continue your progress, you’ll need to manually transfer your old save files to the new save location.

There’s a bit of an issue with the EA app (as usual, unfortunately). If you’re playing on multiple devices like a Steam Deck and a Windows 11 desktop, the app prompts a sync at every launch, which makes it far too easy to accidentally overwrite or delete your save file—potentially losing hours of progress. The game’s cloud save relies on EA’s system, which feels clunky compared to the seamless integration of Steam Cloud saves.

I’d put off playing this last entry in the trilogy for a while, but it turned out to be well worth it, offering a satisfying conclusion to many characters’ storylines. The included DLCs also enhance the companions’ backstories and make Shepard seem more personable and connected to the team than in previous games.

It’s hard to spoil the series, as there aren’t any single plot points that drastically alter the overall story. So even if you’re starting now, you’re safe from major spoilers. Aside from the gameplay being a cover shooter typical of its time, this remains one of the best examples of storytelling and world-building in gaming.

This was one of my favorite game series to play while growing up. Being able to play the entire series again has been insanely fun and a great use of time in my life. Excusing a couple of DLCs here and there that I wasn't able to play when I was younger, I remember this game like the back of my hand and it has been a treat to revisit.

All of this to be said; I had never played all of the DLC's in the third game and I didn't know what I was missing.

The Citadel DLC in Mass Effect 3 has easily become my favorite part of this series by far. I wish I had played it sooner. The insane switch to a more comedic, lighthearted experience in the Mass Effect universe was jarring at first, but I quickly came around to enjoy it so much. It genuinely made me laugh at times, and being able to play with characters that you haven't seen much in this game was really nostalgic in a way. The scene where you fight with everyone was really cool to experience as well. 

But I think my favorite part about this DLC had to be the Party. Being able to mingle with everyone, see how characters that never met interact with each other. My heart felt so full and happy the morning after. After I had talked to everyone with their hangovers, I felt a sense of peace and calm. Something you rarely get in this series. It felt like waking up at a sleepover with your friends, and it was a feeling that genuinely made me say to myself ""Damn, I wish I didn't have to leave this moment.""

The next time I play this series again, it will be for that moment.

Even after 15 years, the trilogy is the best and most unique thing I've ever played. I don't know of anything comparable, where 3 games build on each other directly and across the story.

That's what makes the experience so intense. You will be taken on a long journey with the Normandy crew, you laugh and cry with the characters, you try to make the right decisions and discover one of the best science fiction stories I know.

It's worth taking the time to get to know this amazing and complex world.

+ an emotional experience
+ intense and exciting story
+ cut scenes are staged like an action film
+ great squad members and characters
+ despite the serious main story, there's always plenty to laugh about (hello Citadel DLC!!)

+ you create your own main character and get your own personal story

This trilogy is currently on sale for less than the price of a McDonald's meal and you owe yourself to play it if you're a fan of RPG's/3rd person shooters.

Also, there are people (fake ME fans) that will tell you to skip Mass Effect 1 but don't do it. Mass Effect 1 is arguably the only actual ""RPG"" in the series, has the best lore/atmosphere, and the best cast.

Mass Effect 1 - Best game in the series IMO. While the shooting mechanics can be a bit jank, it's still a great game and the ""fixes"" in the Legendary Edition will definitely help ease newcomers to the game. This game is tragically misunderstood. It's an RPG first and a Shooter second. You're not supposed to be a god with every weapon that lands in your hands. You're supposed to level up your skills and get better with the weapons/skills your class is designed to use.. you know, typical RPG stuff. But for some reason this has really flown over peoples' heads and they just immediately label this game trash for it. 

Mass Effect 2 - 2nd best game in the trilogy. This game is more of a 3rd person shooter in the sense that it's basically a cover based shooter with cleaner mechanics but with RPG elements. The atmosphere and world building are still really good and the cast is largely fantastic. The story and main quest can be a bit disappointing because essentially 80% of the game is just you building your team and doing side stuff and the final boss is a bit of a let down.

Mass Effect 3 - Worst entry in the trilogy. It's basically a Gears of War game but in the Mass Effect universe. It's not a BAD game but it's just not a good Mass Effect game in my opinion. The game has the weakest cast and won't satisfy you if you're a fan of actual RPG's. 

Overall all these games are worth a play-through. I rate the whole trilogy 9/10.

Each planet, species, and character is endowed with a distinct ethos and pathos, contributing to an extremely rich, multi-layered narrative that's accompanied by branching reflective of the finest out there; repercussions of player choices extend far beyond immediate consequences and arise much later on in the trilogy.

Moreover, the series eschews simplistic moral binaries, opting for a game resplendent with dilemmas that are rich in moral complexity and ethical nuance, sure to gratify even the most scholarly of philosophers. With a foundation in philosophical study myself, I was deeply engrossed in the ethical quandaries and choices that permeate the narrative.

Ultimately, within the vast expanse of video game history, no narrative has achieved the depth, intricacy, and emotional resonance I encountered in Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. I consider myself exceedingly privileged to have experienced this magnum opus for the first time at the age of 25.

But damn was I wrong. I am a sucker for good characters and their flavour text, and this game has it in abundance, all voiced too, and well, which is such a rarity. I remember hearing the end was bad, too, so I was reluctant to get into it. It's not. 

This series is timeless, especially with this edition giving it modern visuals, and I pray this doesn't get another sequel because we all know it would be absolutely terrible and a disgrace to the amazing job they did with this series. It is an experience you will likely never find anywhere else.

I went into this expecting it to be a difficult shooter and using a mage-like class instead, but after locking in the default no-magic class in the first game by mistake, I discovered an interesting truth: this series was not designed to be challenging. And don't misunderstand-- I avoid shooters like the plague because my aim is absolutely terrible. But after walking through a giant mass of enemies and shooting them one-by-one with a shotgun on Veteran, I needed combat to be more mentally stimulating and switched to the hardest difficulty, Insanity. Made the game more fun for sure. Battles were slowly feeling like just a nuisance before it, which isn't ideal. 

Regarding each game in detail:

--- 1 ---
The first game was never any trouble whatsoever, not even at the final boss. I only ever died when I was messing around running straight into them, or letting snipers shoot me in the head. That only kills you on Insanity, so you might want to play it straight off-the-bat if you want enemies to actually be threatening. You can get an achievement for sticking with it without having to restart, too. I know I regret not doing so... And you can change your class at the beginning of the next game, so consider trying the Soldier class out before resigning yourself to magic because the first game is super easy anyway. Bring Wrex and Liara to Noveria for flavour text. Use the Citadel elevators with different combinations for more. Bring Ashley and Kaidan to Virmire for the optimal experience.

--- 2 ---
In the second game, almost every boss/final stage is actually challenging, but never feels impossible... for the most part (Insanity only, wouldn't be very engaging otherwise). I play on the Steam Deck though, and taking cover is changed in this game in a way that makes it very easy to accidentally get yourself killed trying... I might just suck, though. Yet I beat the game on Insanity. Do yourself a favour and play on Insanity. As for flavour text: 
- Consider recruiting everyone first before doing sidequests by advancing the plot, as bringing people you normally get later on can make them very interesting. This is especially true when rescuing a father from a ship infested with geth-- just keep in mind, though, that there may be consequences to this that you may not realize can even exist. But they're expected to happen, FWIW. Up to you. But decide before the IFF. And don't bring Archangel to the ship if you want dialogue, they don't say anything. 
- Bring Archangel and their friend on both recruitment missions in Illium for an unusually larger amount of dialogue. The Citadel too, for a special staircase convo. Consider taking Archangel on the cab, too. Their friend has no dialogue.
- Bring Zaeed to the special missions for flavour text on the ship, if there's no one else you want to bring. Keep in mind what I mentioned earlier. 
- Bring Archangel's friend to the ritual for a peak comedy reaction. 
- Bring Miranda and your romance (if you have one) after the seeker swarms at the very end, specifically in that order, for special dialogue and to spice up the final cutscene. It might also save a life...
- The new characters don't rejoin you in the next game, they only cameo, so it's not worth save scumming if they die. Their deaths also make the next game more interesting. And everyone can die. Do with that information what you wish.

--- 3 ---
The third game is the only one that is actually designed to be difficult. On Insanity, I think some are intended to only be beatable by using heavy weapons on the ground. I'm almost certain the game never acknowledges their existence until the final battle. It's definitely still worth playing on Insanity, just make sure to look around on Palaven. There's a new roll mechanic implemented, but from my experience on Steam Deck, it is a curse. What I said before about accidentally dying very easily in the second game is even worse in the third. Want to take cover? Nah, you roll and get shot while exposed, aaand you're dead. Using a panel? Nope, roll, enemies in hiding run up and fill you with holes before you get back up, you're dead. Running? Nope, roll. Now you're dead. Vaulting? Roll. You vault after too late and get gunned down in the open like the degenerate you are. This might seem unnecessary to go through, but sometimes you have to rush through enemies to progress. The encounters can actually be really difficult, so failing a winning attempt because the game keeps making me roll was incredibly frustrating, especially because you usually die within 2 seconds on Insanity (I'm not exaggerating--and I'm playing the class intended to take hits. Do not invest in health boosts on Insanity). You can't rebind Steam Deck controls either. Playing on PC with a keyboard is the best way to play if you have that option, I think. 

I discovered a way to enjoy Insanity despite this, however, but it's undoubtedly incredibly overpowered and I have no idea how it got in. There's a shotgun called the Venom that, when charged up, one-shots a lot of enemies in the game. Not the bigger ones and bosses thankfully, but Centurions and weaker. Their health will drop fast though, so if you use it, the battles can become a fiesta running around and stalling for flavour text, which can be fairly entertaining. Just don't run ahead or you might cut some of it off. If you want to be able to beat Insanity without a doubt, the Venom guarantees it. Going back to flavour text:
- Bring the originals to the first priority mission on Tuchanka.
- If you cheated and can do this, bring both to the dreadnought. Mind this one is theoretical, this might be nothing special. It's probably what I think, though. Otherwise, bring the duo.
- Bring the duo to Grissom Academy and the asari request.
- Bring Javik to Thessia.
- Bring your romance to Eden Prime, when confronting the Leviathan, and when the robot is mandatory. Recall the ones from the second game only cameo. Priority missions don't need to be done within a timeframe, it just advances plot. That being said...
- Avoid the sidequests until you get the crew back together, minus Wrex. They don't expire until a fairly obvious point, and nothing bad happens if you stall. I'd speak to Jondum Bau last.
- Avoid the Personal Apartment until you get the crew back together, minus Wrex, and after Eden Prime. For comedic purposes, don't meet with Ashley for lunch at the Citadel until after the gathering at the Apartment.
- When you go to the final area, dog-legs says nothing when you first arrive. Take them in the battle after if you romanced them, or whoever you did. If you take dog-legs, take Scars too for maximum emotional impact. Javik doesn't say anything special in that fight.
- Some convos between characters have multiple lines before speaking to them. Walk away and back to check. Also check afterward. ""Support"" ones loop, don't feel rushed to choose.
- Take your time between battles, there's no negative consequence. You might get ambushed at one point... but flavour text.

I've since travelled full star systems and hopped relays to new ones, probed the hell out of planets and asteroids for resources to strengthen my ship, fought aliens and hivemind robots alike, saved the galaxy several times, and fallen in love thrice with the personalities of the characters around me on my journeys.

This game is the ultimate masterpiece of a story-telling shooter RPG, giving you many different opportunities to shape the story according to your own will, with all the small decisions carrying weight not only in one game but through the whole trilogy. 
This game is, and will forever be, my favourite game of all time in the space-science-fiction area, and no other game like this will ever be created in the genre.

The weakest part of this game is the shooting, though it's still great imho.

I completed all 3 games 5+ times, as I own the original hard copy on the EA (Origin) launcher. I bought this remastered version and it was stunning, beautiful, and simply perfect. The full 100% completionist with all Steam achievements and nearly 100% in all 3 games took me something around 150 hours.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MASTERPIECE

[h2]”I have some time to read a complete review” version[/h2]

Context: I’ve bought this trilogy 3 times already: PC (EA), PS, PC (Steam). Saw the 90% sale and thought it could be cool to buy this “new” version and do it all again. So, I did.

Even though it’s on sale now, it's important to note that the regular price can be quite steep. However, given the enhancements and the convenience of having all three games and their DLCs in one package, it's a worthy investment for both newcomers and long-time fans of the series imo.

To go into further details, here’s why I think everything in these games is top-level:

[h3]✓ Deep and Engaging Lore[/h3]

The most captivating aspect of the Mass Effect series is its rich and immersive lore. From the intricate history of the different alien races to the complex political landscape, every detail is meticulously crafted, making the universe feel alive and dynamic. If you’re a fan of sci-fi, the depth of the world-building will keep you engrossed for hours on end.

[h3]✓ Incredible Storytelling[/h3]

Mass Effect's narrative is one of its strongest points. The trilogy offers a compelling story arc that spans all three games, with decisions in the first game impacting the story in the latter ones. This interconnectivity creates a sense of continuity and consequence rarely seen in other games (granted, I haven’t played much lately). The plot twists, character arcs, and moral dilemmas ensure a memorable experience.

[h3]✓ Outstanding Soundtrack[/h3]

The music in Mass Effect is nothing short of phenomenal. Composers like Jack Wall and Sam Hulick have crafted a soundtrack that perfectly complements the epic scale of the game's narrative. From the hauntingly beautiful melodies to the adrenaline-pumping battle themes, the music enhances every moment of the game. My guilty pleasure is to stay on the galaxy map, watching the planets and listening to the background theme, imagining how many years it would take my spaceship to reach those distant worlds. This ambient music not only sets the mood but also deepens the sense of immersion, making the universe feel even more expansive and real.

[h3]✓ Charismatic Characters[/h3]

One of the defining features of Mass Effect is its diverse cast of characters. Each character has a unique personality, backstory, and development arc. The relationships you build with your squadmates are pivotal to the story, and the emotional connections you form are genuinely impactful. Whether it’s the loyalty missions or the casual conversations aboard the Normandy, these interactions are deeply satisfying.

[h3]✓ Intuitive Gameplay[/h3]

The gameplay mechanics, while slightly dated, still hold up well. The blend of third-person shooting with RPG elements creates an engaging and strategic combat system. The inclusion of different classes and abilities allows for varied playstyles, keeping the gameplay fresh. The only downside is that some mechanics, especially in the first game, might feel a bit clunky compared to modern standards, but you can use mods to counter these (minor) annoying aspects of the games. It's also worth mentioning that the game itself can feel a bit slow at times, compared to more recent games.

[h3]✓ Improved Graphics[/h3]

The remastered graphics in the Legendary Edition are a significant upgrade from the original releases. Environments are more detailed, character models are enhanced, and the overall visual fidelity is greatly improved. However, while the graphics are better, they still can't fully mask the fact that the games are over a decade old (even almost 2 decades for the first game).

[h3]✓ Great Value for Money (on Sale)[/h3]

Currently, the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is on a 90% sale, making it an absolute steal. For the amount of content and the quality of the experience, this is an offer that’s hard to pass up. That said, it's worth mentioning that even at full price, the trilogy provides countless hours of entertainment and replayability, making it a worthwhile investment for any fan of the genre.

[h3]Conclusion ✓✓✓✓✓[/h3]

If you’re a sci-fi fan, love deep storytelling, and enjoy character-driven narratives, the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a must-play. Despite some dated gameplay mechanics (that can be countered with mods), the overall experience is unparalleled. The combination of improved graphics, engaging gameplay, fantastic soundtrack and a rich, immersive universe makes this trilogy a timeless classic.

Is what many would say when asked to speak of it.

I do not know many games, where different choices pass onto and influence the following game and ITS choices in meaningful ways. 
It's not something that happens really.
What developer would have the courage, and gall to create a game, knowing the fulfillment of choices made, might never come to fruition if the franchise fails. Such a tailored experience is almost doomed to fall through on paper. 
Bioware did it though. 
And what a massive achievement that was, and still is. 
That being said Mass Effect was never perfect, EA certainly didn't make it better on that part. 
Whether you prefer the original RPG system in 1 or the compact more fast-paced ARPG system in 2 and 3 there is enjoyment to be had. In the end we were/are all here for the story, the characters and the universe. 


I bought Mass Effect legendary edition for 3 euro, prior to this I had completed Mass Effect 2 with no DLC's exclusively. When I first played 2, Characters were gone. I didn't even know I was missing so many of them or so much knowledge from 1. 
Playing the full trilogy from start to end....

Mass Effect, given its age, received a lot of improvements to make it feel more modern. But despite that, it remains the weakest game in the trilogy. Its biggest strength is without a doubt the story, characters, and overall presentation. Despite being part of a continuous trilogy, the story here is contained with a satisfactory ending, without baiting you for the next entry. Well, it actually baits you, but in a good way, because you enjoyed it and want to see more. It’s a sci-fi adventure in space, with great lore and characters, both the major NPC’s and even smaller ones. The game also has lots of different dialogue options and choices to make, which carry over to the other titles. In a nutshell, you can be a Paragon, making the altruistic and “best” choices, or a Renegade, by being a jackass. While in the end you’ll probably want to do a Paragon playthrough for the save import, I highly recommend you try a Renegade one before that. The game is just way funnier that way.
The gameplay, unfortunately, is just meh. It’s a third person shooter, aided by 2 squad members. There’s some special abilities and “superpowers”, but overall, the shooting mechanics are nothing special. Still, I wouldn’t say they’re bad. There’s a lot of RPG elements, and those thankfully fare a lot better. It’s the usual stuff, getting XP to level up, getting and equipping better and better loot, and upgrading your abilities. Since the game is set in space, there’s also a lot of optional exploration to do. Unfortunately, it’s also meh. Basically, you drive a vehicle through barren planets collecting stuff and entering recycled buildings with fights to complete side quests. It’s mostly boring. Some planet sky vistas are pretty, though. But there’s no denying that exploring planets is mostly a chore, unfortunately.
Mass Effect 2 just blows the first game away. It is so much better in almost everything, making it one of my favorite games of all time. So, how exactly it is better than the original? Once again, where the game really excels is in its story, characters and presentation, although here it’s a bit different. The original title focused on introducing this universe while telling a mostly contained story. This time, the main story is shorter and feels a bit filler, to be honest. Instead, the game this time focuses on its characters, telling a lot of different, more standalone stories that are more self-contained. The main game revolves around gathering a lot of crew members to attempt a suicide mission, tied with the main story. And for that, you’ll need to recruit them, get involved with them, and optionally you can further help them with their personal problems, in the form of loyalty missions. While they’re optional, the game advises you to do them, and their quality is the same as the main game. Basically, they’re optional main missions, instead of side quests. So, most of the game is focused on its characters, and of course, they’re varied and interesting. And there’s a lot of them, 12 in your squad, your ship crew and a lot more NPC’s. This is what Bioware used to do best, and you can fully see it here. The morality system returns, and this time there’s even some real time “interrupts”, which are awesome to perform. Once again, even if in the end you’ll want a Paragon playthrough with the “best” choices to import your save, I highly suggest a Renegade playthrough first, it’s funnier and perhaps more impactful. Speaking of save import, you’ll see a lot of your choices made in the original game reflected here. Most of them just impact small stuff, but together they make you see why the series is designed as a trilogy. Also, a lot of choices (and lack of) throughout the game will have an impact in the final suicide mission, which even today few games can reach that level.
So, the story and characters are better, but what you’ll notice is the greatly improved gameplay. While it may feel a bit standard for the third person shooter genre, it is miles better than the original. The gameplay is completely redesigned, and it’s basically a solid third person shooter. Again, in the end it’s nothing special for the genre, but it’s great after playing the original. There’s a solid cover mechanic, and an ammo system, which I disliked. Classes and powers are rebalanced. It’s just a way more solid experience. Another thing I noticed was that a lot of the RPG elements from the original are streamlined or just gone. It is more of a shooter and less of an RPG. But I didn’t mind it much, especially because I loved the leap in gameplay from the original. Another big omission is the Mako planet exploration. Instead of improving it, they just removed it. Instead, you’ll have a planet scanning minigame, which is addictive at first but quickly gets repetitive. You’ll need it to find side quests, which are basically mini missions, and resources to get upgrades. This is perhaps my main complaint about this game. I preferred to have improved Mako explorations, which seemed like a natural improvement for a sequel instead of just removing it, but the game has so much content that in the end it isn’t a big deal, just a missed opportunity. The soundtrack is also just as great. It was great in the original, it is also great this time.
Mass Effect 3 plays similarly to 2, for the most part. Perhaps the biggest difference is in the story and its scope. 2 was focused on recruiting and bonding with your crew. This time it’s about an epic galactic war, where you aid the various alien races, and get resources to help create the only weapon that can defeat the enemy forces. It also brings closure to some of the biggest lore plots, like the genophage and the war between the quarians and the geth. And of course, most choices are up to you. You can be a Paragon hero, or a Renegade jackass (still worth a playthrough for that, the Renegade options are way funnier).
The graphics are slightly improved, and the soundtrack is good as usual. What the game does best is making you feel that you are in the middle of an epic galactic war. The endings are decent, but the problem is that for a huge trilogy focused on player choice, most of them just translate to resources, affecting your ending options and some slightly different scenes in there. However, don’t forget the plot closures, that act as semi-endings of some sort.
This game also includes one of the best DLCs in videogame history, the Citadel, and it has everything that a final game in a trilogy like this should have: a lighthearted story focused on comedy to give us some change, an amazing party with all alive crew members that you prepare and throw, with plenty of interactions (the best part) and even an arena for more replayability with end game combat, if that’s you thing, with more squad mates joining you for those battles. And the more you are invested in this universe and its characters, the better it will be. It’s just that good.
Despite its rough past on Steam, where you couldn’t get all the 3 games and DLCs on Steam, I’m glad that finally everything is conveniently available in one title, making those issues a thing of the past. And for me, if you count this as one game, it’s one of the best of all time, and of course, an easy recommendation. The cherry on top is that it’s often dirt-cheap during sales. You must install and use the EA app, which is annoying, but to be honest, for the most part I forgot it was there. I didn’t find it to be intrusive, but that doesn’t mean I’m ok with third party launchers.

[b] Mass Effect [/b]

The first game in Legendary Edition is absolutely monumental. Its epic story and breathtaking presentation bring every emotional fluctuation I would hope for in such a heroic space adventure. And the music! There are all sorts of games with great music, but very few if not none of them can reach the quality in this game. The revelation of Citadel is no less an enchanted grandeur than that time Frodo enters Rivendell. Not to mention the final battle and from the wreckage scene, the latter being one of the most powerful moments I have ever experienced in video games.

Sure, there are lots of empty worlds and repetitive level designs, but the diverse scenery is actually enjoyable and brings plenty of Star Trek vibes, that is, if the player is not OCD over every collectible. Fortunately, most of them just give money (you will have much surplus without them) and a little experience (can't hit max level in one playthrough anyway), so you won't be missing anything. Nevertheless, there is hardly a more rewarding moment when all these efforts culminate in the final events. If all comes down to one thing, this game delivers a good adventure, which is just a bit too good.

[b] Mass Effect 3 [/b]

My first complaint is its inconsistent production quality. How can a game boasts some of the best narrative executions, but at the same time being so ridiculous in audio implementation? And where are the great soundtracks? Even the reused ones from the first game feel out-of-place constantly. Don't even start on details like distant husks in tutorial mission, yikes!

The biggest letdown IMO however, is the lack of credibility in world-building contexts. I can sense how much effort the writers make to convey the desperate and people banding together in overall atmosphere, but suddenly every civilian/soldier/refugee from all species start loving each other and talking honor and ready to sacrifice? It just seems too fairy-tale and ideal. It really should take notes from Halo: Reach, which had very similar story contexts and was released two years earlier than this game, but it portrayed a more authentic scape without sacrificing any of its romanticism. 

That being said, Mass Effect 3 undoubtedly excels at certain defining elements that makes this series special. The heart-stirring cinematic stroytelling, the rich interactions between crewmates, and the exceptionally memorable side characters; what this series sell on, this game does the best. By comparison, the previously mentioned flaws would seem trivial. With the addition of a more sophisticated combat system and upscaled level design, this game elevates the brand to a new level of excellence.

[b] Mass Effect 2 [/b]

I enjoyed this games as much as the other two games, in fact I probably spent longest hours in this game. The problem is, I am constantly reminded by the game that I am manipulated by it. 

I liked it in Mass Effect 1 and 3 and many other RPGs, that I met all different companions under vast varieties of circumstances, and discovered why/how we are going to work together in the process. It is an enticing and natural flow, just how I imagined an adventure. I liked it less when being thrown a list of people to hire, without even knowing them. Why these particular people are on the list? There is very little explanation in this game, and for some of those people, I still don't understand even after finishing the game several times.

Also I enjoyed the immersion when my choices have moral consequences. But it is much less enjoyable when forced onto a moral compass without a compelling context, while all choices are unpleasant or extreme not of necessity. In this game, there are too many such instances. [spoiler] Work for a boss everyone hates while being verbally incapable to explain; kidnap a girl to protect her while required to hate someone opposing it out of good intention; promise to help a friend but must betray him to save some people. [/spoiler] The pattern is that, the game makes it seems the players are intentionally making choices of being a zealot or a sociopath while there is not really a ""different"" path, and then it judges the players either way. On the opposite side, picking from my favorites with comparable scope and release date, Dishonored (2012) made itself the exemplar of ""make our choices and take what comes""; then in 2015, the Witcher 3 perfected the meaning of ""I’d rather not choose at all"". In both cases, the games provide enough compelling contexts and reasonable divergence for the players to stay true to their characters, only to be judged by themselves from the within.

Lair of the Shadow Broker: This DLC dives deep into the enigmatic world of the elusive Shadow Broker, offering intense action, gripping narrative, and a chance to reconnect with Liara T'Soni. The added cinematic flair and impactful decisions make it a must-play.

Citadel: A love letter to fans, Citadel brings humor, camaraderie, and heart to the forefront. It's a perfect blend of lighthearted banter and emotional reunions, allowing players to forge deeper connections with their squadmates in a farewell celebration.

Omega: Immerse yourself in the gritty underworld of Omega alongside Aria T'Loak. This action-packed expansion adds layers to the Cerberus threat while offering a unique perspective on the galaxy's darker corners.

For players seeking a passionate and tumultuous romance, Jack's storyline delivers. The scarred and rebellious biotic powerhouse opens up layers of vulnerability, making her a compelling partner. Navigating through Jack's tough exterior to discover the complexities within adds a poignant touch to Shepard's personal journey.

In the Legendary Edition, the visual enhancements bring these emotional moments to life, allowing players to experience Jack's romance with a newfound depth. Whether revisiting the romance or discovering it for the first time, Jack's storyline remains a poignant highlight in the Mass Effect trilogy, contributing to the emotional tapestry of the entire saga.",1705514344,1705514344,True,20,1,0.684866726398468,0,True,False,False,False,1328670,20250114_132033,positive,100

From the original stand alone games to a game that houses all 3, this is THE Mass Effect experience.

If you are familiar with Mass Effect, this one has all the DLCs included so now you have another reason to play the game again!

If you're not, not to worry, no spoilers here. All you need to know is that choices have an impact in this series. Some are small, some are huge, but it all depends on how what you choose.

This will be a very brief overview of what each game has to offer:

Mass Effect 1 - Introduction to the characters, environments, terminology, mechanics and the overall universe that is Mass Effect. You get used to how the powers work and how your weapons and shields handle during firefights. You scan/mine minerals directly on the planets with the Mako (never really liked this because it just felt flimsy and ragdolly, although in ME LE they did improve the mechanics a bit). Paragon (good) and Renegade (evil) has been introduced and each choice always has one or the other (sometimes both) impact on how good or evil you are.

Mass Effect 2 - A return of your character and the combat mechanics have been seriously upgraded to be even smoother and combos of powers have been introduced. They have swapped out the overheating mechanic with an ammo based system for your weapons and it works better in my honest opinion. You have access to scan and mine a world from orbit without having to drop with the Mako (it's been removed in this one) which I find a lot better! Lore has been improved and is even more solid noow. You meet new characters, meet old ones again and make even more decisions. New weapons and armour to use and equip. Customization to armour has been added. Bigger enemies and more fleshed out backstories of characters in the DLCs.

Mass Effect 3 - The one where everything ties back together again. New and old characters, combat is even tighter and powers are fleshed out more, but relatively stay close to what is in ME2. Characters are also more developed and you really start to love these characters for their personalities. The DLC Citadel brought tears to my eyes because it was an ode to what has happened to these characters and how they have grown over the years to where they are now and how your choices have affected them. Amazing attention to detail and an amazing story that concludes.

I can't stress enough how much of an amazing game this is. Everything in this game clicks extremely well. The Paragon/Renegade system works, the dialogue option wheel was patented for this game and it shows! It works amazingly well and you learn it super fast! Top left is ALWAYS Paragon (in blue) and bottom left is ALWAYS Renegade (in red). Top right is good response, middle right is neutral and bottom right is sarcastic/evil response. This game's art design, the music, the story, the characters, the DLCs even! Everything of this game just works extremely well.

If you haven't tried this yet and you're looking for a reason, this is it. It's hands down, one of my top 3 favourite all-time games. I even added some extra mods for Quality of Life stuff and added armour and weapons and graphics enhancements.

This is what made BioWare such a great company and it's such a shame they didn't stick to this formula. Solid 11/10.",1717263365,1717263365,True,28,1,0.6822804808616638,0,False,True,False,False,1328670,20250114_132033,positive,100

Got this for 5 quid on sale, might as well have pirated it.

Initially I was going to stick with the original release for my next playthrough, but I ended up giving it a try due to the sale.

Legendary edition, compared to the original version, has way more modding options.
Gameplay-wise the games are the same except for LE1, which had the combat system greatly improved. 
The classic combat was serviceable, but not that good, this version feels much more responsive now.

https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffectlegendaryedition/mods/1500
Mods like these were the first things I installed for MELE, since its biggest flaw is that the technology being used is superior, but you can very clearly tell the design team is different and much less talented than the original team who made the game. A lot of the lighting is much more washed out and soulless, but you can correct it with mods like MELLO that preserve the original artstyle while still giving you the enhanced textures and gameplay.


TL;DR:
Gameplay in ME1 is enhanced, lots more mods than the original versions, and puts all of the DLC in the base game so you don't have to go faffing about on EA's websites. 
Pinnacle Station from ME1 isn't in the game which is lame. 
But that's honestly forgiveable since after playing it in the OG version on my last playthru I can 100% confirm it's just a glorified arena.

Biggest flaw by far is the inferior lighting which makes the game look plasticy and soulless, but if you're willing to install some mods and the ME3Tweaks manager, you can rectify these errors.

I played all these way back when they originally released and would even recommend the original versions to purists. However, IMO these updates are amazing. So far I have not encountered issues of any kinda, just lots of graphical update beauty. I couldn't find references to cut content online, so I assume its all there and more. If anything changes, I will update.
Currently playing on Insanity and its pretty easy.  If you're a modern gamer looking for a challenge, you might be disappointed. Play it mainly for the story and the retro gameplay/exploration loop.

In my opinion whats at the heart of this series like any good Bioware RPG are the characters. From the moment you meet them, to how they change and the culmination of their arcs based on your choices, they are what makes the trilogy so special.

That's why The Citadel DLC works so well. It's a love letter to everything great about the series and what makes it so special.

The main story is good in all three games (although its barely there in ME2) and very enjoyable with it's twists and turns. What Sets it apart is the choices you make. They might be small choices that affect a small thing or major ones that carry their weight in later games each choice whether small or big has a consequence you see later and makes the story all the more personal. It can be as big as killing a companion in the first game so that an event plays out differently in the third or as small as meeting someone you saved before. You can even kill most of your crew and have a shit third game where barely anyone is there but it's your choices and it makes them special. The culmination of every arc and issue introduced in the first game is determined by your actions and in my opinion makes ME3 as a whole The ending rather than the final 15 minutes of the game.

If you are here for the combat its not really the main focus. Even with the changes to ME1 it can feel clunky and i tried to avoid it as much a i could. ME2 becomes more action focused but ME3 is what makes the combat really work. Weapons feel different and powerful, the encounters are balanced and even on instanity it's fun which is what really matters. Your class can make a difference in your abilities and the guns you can use but the three classes i played as all felt fun in their own way and it doesn't hold you back from enjoying the games.

If you like RPGs or other Bioware games or just want a fun story and a memorable journey give this trilogy a try. You might grow to love it.",1734012905,1734012905,True,4,0,0.5720869302749633,0,True,False,False,False,1328670,20250114_132033,positive,100

Mass Effect 2 takes everything of Mass Effect and improves it. More streamlined gameplay, more action-focused, a deepening of the story, with better graphics and even better sound. I consider it one of the best games of all time.

For Mass Effect 3, they changed writers and it shows. The writing is a big disappointment and as generic as they come. The gameplay is devolved from RPG with a bit of shooting in ME1, to full-out shooter in ME3, and the graphics can be qualified as ""lots of blue and lots of bloom"". Still, you do really feel the desperation of a society suddenly collapsing, and the emotional bond with the characters you've met over the course of 2 large games is a strong as the best games out there.

One of the best trilogies in entertainment history now bundled, remastered into 1 accessible package for future generations to enjoy. Mass Effect is an epic sci-fi, 3rd person shooter RPG that spans across 3 games. 
Each game will carry over decisions and outcomes from previous game, which makes it mandatory to play the game chronologically. 

[h1]MASS EFFECT 1[/h1]
Intro to the series, some of the gameplay mechanics has been reworked to make it feel more modern compared to the rest of the series. You can freely use any guns now without being restricted or penalized for using specific weapons in a class you choose.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
+Great introduction to the universe
+Great class systems, each class have unique abilities 
+Good squadmates with cool personalities
+Unique sci fi aesthetics

[h1]CONS[/h1]
-Repetetive map layouts for planet outpost missions
-Bad waypoint system for quests, sometimes its very annoying to navigate a map when quests dont appear on map
-It is still a 2007 game but with some touchups 

[h1]MASS EFFECT 2[/h1]
The goat of the series (supposedly) it has several gameplay upgrades, even the graphics got better obviously, more squadmates than the 1st game though some dont join us anymore

[h1]PROS[/h1]
+Better gunplay and combat than the previous game
+Better graphics
+You can bring up to 5 weapons to missions
+Plot is more dark, Illusive Man has great voice acting
+Epic final mission that has very high stakes
+Fantastic missions, both base game and DLCs (Though all content are now included in this version)
+Epic set pieces

[h1]CONS[/h1]
-A bit streamlined perks progression but not really a big deal
-Weapons lack of customization (This is fixed in ME3)
-Cannot romance non squad members who were previous squadmates 

[h1]Mass Effect 3[/h1]
The series finale. Every decisions that you made in previous games all comes to this game.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
+Best combat and gameplay in entire series, the guns just feel so good to shoot till this day its still has the best shooting mechanics out of any 3rd person shooter i ever played
+Best graphics in the series
+The mission intro debriefs before mission starts are a nice touch and adds to the immersion
+All DLC missions (Leviathan, Omega, Citadel) are epic
+Epic missions and setpieces throughout the game

[h1]CONS[/h1]
-The endings are still super controversial to this day, you may like or not like it at all
-Multiplayer mode not included sadly, this mode is coop horde shooter and it is a lot of fun and you can play as any aliens in the series
-If you skip to this game without importing your save from prev games, the outcomes will suck.
-The final battle should have been longer (Its clear Bioware were rushed and ran out of time back then)

Overall this is a great package if you want hours of content and the replayability is there if you want to try out different classes and replay doing different decisions.
It is easily a must have game for any Steam Library

I hear they are making an ME4 but if the new dragon age game is to go off of, I do not want Biowoke touching this series and honestly in my head cannon the series should end here. that being said these 3 games are absolutely amazing.

Pros: fantastic story, fantastic character development, Tear jerking endings, fantastic game play in all ways.

Cons: some minor graphical glitches. Particularly weird animation glitches, on a handful of occasions hit markers not registering when I was using a sniper rifle despite being aimed directly at the head.

I must have well over 11,000 hours of combined playtime from all the games (ME3 Xbox 360 multiplayer and ME: Andromeda included) under my belt.

I have nothing but good things to say about this videogame franchise:

1) Your actions & dialogue choices have major consequences & effects that result in triumphs, deaths, losses, and victories. And it’s clear that an immense weight is put on your shoulders to do the right thing… but you don’t have to shoulder that burden alone, because you have incredibly loyal squad-mates & crew who’ll follow you anywhere.

2) Speaking of squad-mates, the level of depth of connections you make with your squad-mates are unmatched by any other game out there. 2a) You can take your squad-mates with you on missions—where they have unique responses to what’s going on around them, & in response to your actions.

3) There’s a dark & foreboding undertone that gets more dark as the games progress, which finalizes in ME3; all of which, has purpose.

4) Most of the aliens in the game actually LOOK and behave alien… plus, you can romance some of those aliens that have unique physical features!

Besides Skyrim, there has been NO OTHER RPG that just... KEEPS bringing me back to do another playthrough. I truly believe that the Mass Effect franchise is the BEST RPG series ever made. Baldur's Gate 3 comes close in being 2nd place, but even it, with all its bells and whistles and WAY more in-depth control over the story than you do as Shepherd in Mass Effect, can't claim the title for being best RPG ever made in my book... there's just something nostalgic, epic, and inspiring about the Mass Effect franchise has that trumps all other RPG's out there.

It is frankly priceless, there is no amount of money you could apply to the quality of the game, but the people responsible for this masterpiece have had their work ripped away from them by a greedy, malignant body intent on empowering themselves off of the work of others. 

There are ways you can play games without paying for them, by the way. That's all I'm going to say on that matter.

[quote=article]
As part of looking into the layoffs yesterday, one source told us that they didn’t think “women were treated the same and that their work wasn’t as valued” at ZA/UM. We asked if Tuulik had seen these issues at the company as well. “Absolutely,” he said. “You’d have to be blind not to. In the PMG documentary, the former DE: Final Cut Lead Writer Helen Hindpere describes a call with the Chief Executive Tõnis Haavel, where Tõnis is screaming at her. It's so loud that a fellow writer who walks in hears the screaming through her headphones and asks what the f**k was that? That writer was me.”
[/quote]

[quote=article]
Dora Klindžić broadly echoed Tuulik’s sentiment: “I've seen good work done at ZA/UM. I've also seen management and production staff terrorizing creatives, lying, playing power games, turning people against each other, destroying relationships and people's self-esteem. For this, there have been no repercussions.”

She also emphasized that some workers would not only lose their jobs, but would have to upend their whole lives as a result of the layoffs: “As a reward for our hard work, some of us are even slated to lose our immigration status in the UK and will have to evacuate the country. We will be gone by next week, but those who remain are grappling with a place irrevocably changed.

“The mask has slipped from the face of capital. What remains at ZA/UM is a cold, careless company where managers wage war against their own creatives, where artistry is second to property, and where corporate strategy is formed by an arrogant disdain for their own audience.”

Naturally, the creators -- who are a minority shareholders at this point-- were deeply concerned by this whole nonsense, and were ultimately pushed out of the company. Insane, right?

I absolutely recommend playing it tho, a little link at the bottom with info. With that out of the way....

This game is my favorite piece of media of all time, its basically an interactive book about a man coming out of a blackout with no memory whatsoever and being told you have to solve a murder. Its got themes of love and lust, sobriety and addiction, and most importantly loss. But also making something new, picking up the pieces of your shattered life and turning them into a mosaic. Or if you prefer, grinding them and your body to dust with the furthering of a drug and drink induced spiral. I've played this game in the throes of addiction, in the midst of sobriety, clear headed and ran ragged and it is ALWAYS relatable. Maybe its just me, but i can see myself in Harry's shoes no matter which path you take.

In the end this game is a story, a choose your own adventure novel and the hardest hurdle to get over was failing checks. My advice? Don't worry, you'll be able to get through the game regardless of success or failure at any point even if you might have to reload at a game over, (keep a few saves) but the failures are part of the experience. In fact, theirs a few hidden things in the game that can only be experienced by failing at certain points. 

It's a narrative worth experiencing, especially if you've ever battled addiction, that will hit home hard. It's permanently altered how i view and feel about the world, for the better. I urge you to give it a go.

I love this game, and think it stands on its own legs as a masterpiece of world-building and character writing. The (original) devs behind this are incredibly talented and have done an amazing job of representing and exploring a myriad of ideologies without making one in particular feel ""right"" or better than others. Your choices are really your own, as are your mistakes. They did a fantastic job of making Revachol feel like a real place with real history, and its inhabitants are all unique and have very distinct personalities and preferences. The world of Elysium and Revachol is humorous but dark, with great stories fleshing them out. I have nothing but great things to say about the game itself. 
So why the ""Not Recommended?"" The creators of the game were forced out of their studio by a scumbag (investor Toni Haavel, convicted of fraud prior) who only cares about profiting off some else's work. That in and of itself is criminal considering that ensures we'll never get the sequel we deserve, and the writer and the others who worked hard on this piece of art now have nothing to show for it. Kurvits and Rostov, the main visionaries and creatives behind the game, recognized the injustice of losing their IP to suits, and asked for documents and financial data to ensure this wasn't what is was: fraudulent. They were fired not long after that. This is a must-play, but I highly encourage you not to pay for it, if you get my drift.

[h2]DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.[/h2] The original artists, story tellers, and dev team had their masterpiece stolen by fraudsters. For more information, see [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1b5zyvsUBY&t=592s]this video.[/url] If anyone tries to tell you that piracy is bad, let them know [i]they are insane and grotesque.[/i]

But how does the game itself stand up?[hr][/hr] [hr][/hr]

[h1]My Review.[/h1]
[h2]Gameplay mechanics are fun and charming.[/h2] It's a click and point adventure game where you're trying to solve a murder. This is done through the use of a skill checks system. Your odds are improved/worsened by your allocated skill points, equipped clothes/items, previous dialogue choices, etc. [i]Failing a skill check's often entertaining in its own right and is sometimes sufficient to progress the story in certain useful/entertaining ways.[/i] You can conceptualize thoughts to help reveal the past of the mentally ill amnesiac detective you play as or adopt multiple often contradictory beliefs. 

[h2]It's profound and narrative-heavy.[/h2] It uses around one million words (like my reviews) to give a voice to its diverse cast while describing Disco's all-too familiar history. Despite this, [i]more often than not this game will be reading you, not the other way around.[/i] Its lore is expansive and detailed. If anyone is looking for pointers on how to describe a scene, a character, or a history, consider Disco a masterclass.

[h2]Sound design is delightful.[/h2] Every footstep on the pavement, note scrawled in your notebook, and thought internalized has an appropriate sound that sucks you into a world [i]you already live in.[/i] The music is great (I play whirling n rags 8:00 when I want to be productive), though the soundtrack has its highs and lows for me. 

[h2]Art direction is inspired.[/h2] This makes sense, as the game had its beginnings in a artist collective. See [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpp54B3RuyQ]this video by Jamrock Hobo[/url] to hear from someone more qualified than me to discuss the game's artistic merit.[hr][/hr]

[h1]My Suggestions.[/h1]
For Disco Devs or people hoping to improve upon the formula, here's a few changes I'd make that likely won't make sense unless you've played it.

[h2]-Rework the archetypes available at the beginning of each game.[/h2] There should be a 4th archetype for motorics. Then distribute the skills to make the differences between the 4 archetypes more pronounced. The thinker shouldn't be 5,1,2,4. It should be 6,2,2,2. The Sensitive should be 2,6,2,2. Physical should be 2,2,6,2. The ""Mover"" should be 2,2,2,6. 

This would've allowed for a 4th attribute portrait (likely tinted yellow and with the theme of ""speed"") of the detective fit for artistic expression and analysis. [i]This alone would be reason enough.[/i] It would also give confidence to new players so they know that however they  allocate their points, the case is likely solvable given how low 3 of your skills can be. I imagine it would also make balance testing easier.

[h2]-Each attribute should have a trippy or extra sensory skill.[/h2] Psyche has both Inland Empire and Esprit De Corps. Physique has Half Light and Shivers. I'm thinking Intellect and Psyche could trade Conceptualization and Esprit De Corps. Physique could give Half Light to Motorics in exchange for a completely new skill. Half Light could replace reactions speed. Then each of the [b]4[/b] archetype would have this skill be their signature one. For this to have the effect I'd want, both Esprit and Halflight would need more fleshing out imo. 

Inland Empire and Shivers are fan favorites. Every attribute should have a version of this. This change would've accomplished this. [i]They wouldn't all be equal, but the attempt would likely mark an improvement.[/i]

[h2]-Add a New Game Plus Mode.[/h2] You would unlock this after beating the game or its hardcore mode. This would remove the cap on skills and allow you to be a god detective. You could choose infinite money. Perhaps you can choose which clothes you've found on previous playthroughs are in your inventory (dialogue that comes with item finding would play once you first equip them instead.) Perhaps you can start off with certain thoughts conceptualized.

It'd be fun for testing. It'd also be nice to see how easy the game is if your detective is a lot more put together. 

[h2]-Thoughts should always enable roleplay, not inhibit. Also, thought synergy should be strived for.[/h2] The most egregious example of this is with Fascist related thoughts. Revacholian Nationhood, the thought that embodies fascism for the detective, punishes your morale every time you use fascist dialogue. [i]I'm aware that this is a clever and funny statement about fascism, but from a gameplay perspective it doesn't make sense.[/i] If I want to play as a fascist and see what disco has to say about it, I am incentivized to limit myself and pursue this by not having the fascist thought. To avoid this, I am compelled to put more points into Psyche. What if I don't want to be an empathetic fascist?

Also, Revacholian Nationhood [b]buffs the positive impact of alcohol.[/b] However, the guy you get this thought from will also likely be the one to offer you the Waste Land of Reality thought, which [b]nerfs the impact of alcohol.[/b] So what's the point?

I suppose having one doesn't mean the other can't exist? Though it makes me wonder who this was intended for, making it a bit of a niche audience, in my opinion.

I am simply incapable of describing the depth of Disco Elysium. 
Was never really bothered by my lack of proficiency in literature -- until I've finished this game.
Disco Elysium changed me. It took me to a fictitious, nonexistent place suspended in codes, animated through digital paintings, voiced by people who ontologically do not exist in that world, and viscerally poured its warm, palpitating, still bleeding heart out to me. I could not, for the life of me, articulate the melancholy, the sudden manifestation of dread, the overwhelming grief, and the almost child-like sense of hope that's been thoroughly dragged through the mud, beaten up and spit on but nevertheless still ever-present, hopeful for a tomorrow that may never come. 
My words plainly fail to capture Disco Elysium - I've felt so much, experienced so much, and have had so much I want to say; yet the moment my hands touches the keyboard, I am at a loss of words - I just don't know how to even begin. This is the first time I have ever truly resented my inability to put my emotions into words.

Perhaps it's for the better.
Disco Elysium is a vigorously crafted piece of art. Its expressive art style, phenomenal voiceover, fleshed out characters and carefully laid-out composite of a post-Soviet eastern European city seamlessly meshed with the unrelenting dialogues and monologues that serves as the backbone of a journey into the back alleys of Revachol through the inner turmoil of a drunken, disheveled husk of a detective. The story itself is nothing but compelling, and the setting itself is so full-of-life that you could almost feel the saltiness of the evening breeze, hijacked by a hint of nicotine leaking from the Whirling-in-Rags linger in your nostril. To describe any more is to rob you, my dear indecisive friend, of an experience that cannot be had again.

Which is why it's imperative that I recommend against buying this game.
ZA/UM in its current incarnation is nothing but a hollow corpse, reanimated and puppeteered by the oh-so-infallible invisible hand with the sole focus of milking the last penny out of Disco Elysium as an IP. The people who made the game -- the artists, writers, programmers, have long been driven away and the studio itself now serves no other purpose than a blood-soaked stele of corporate greed.

Game's fantastic. It's an extremely thought-provoking RPG that manages to be mature with its themes without coming off as pompous or pretentious. The entire idea of a game where you hear every thought going through the main character's head and can act on them accordingly is genius. You hear everything - his small intrusive thoughts, random things he notices, times where he doubts himself, times where he's assure of himself. The game gives you just enough control that nothing feels obtusely unfair, but takes away just enough as to keep you on your toes.

The way your ideology can also push people away and also bring people to you adds even more depth, as it allows you to be true to yourself and see how the characters react, or go completely off the rails and act in ways you never would in real life. Again, truly genius stuff.

Such a unique game, unique concept of helpful (mostly) voices, incredible worldbuilding and amazing voice acting, and undoubtedly, the best writing a game possibly can have, at least from your perspective.

Logic [Trivial:Success] - Yep, makes sense.

Drama [Easy:Success] - Ist complete truth, sire.

Conceptualization [Medium:Success] The world building is absolutely beautifully tremendous, one might say even the best part of game itself, oh, and the ART of the game, the graphics, it all fits together so well.

Inland Empire [Challenging:Success] Yet you feel as you've missed something, the feeling that there is something more to this game, that is hidden behind the curtains, that is beyond your grasp.

Disco Elysium - The choices in that game feel like more than just branching dialogue options, Every little decision you made, whether you sided with certain political ideologies or how you treated characters, changed your playthrough. Even ""Yourself"" can change depending on your choices and beliefs.

Disco Elysium - And look at this, you were a shining super star cop, ranging between communist and moralist, even if that was not what you wanted, those were your own choices. You've never even had alcohol in your hand, didn't do any drugs, and haven't light a single cigarette. Abstained from alcohol completely.

Volition - I am proud of you, you held your will to the very end, not every man could do so, but you did, you should be proud of yourself.

Electro-Chemistry - [Easy:Success] You're a fuскіng рussу, not even a single fuскіng bottle. You missed out on a lot of fun.

Horrific Necktie - Brathan, you've been wandering through this chaos and never even had a drink? What's wrong with you?

Disco Elysium - The game masterfully immerses the player in a wide range of emotions, whether it’s the intense weight of pressure, creeping fear, a sudden wave of sadness that washes over you,, or a moment of awe that leaves you speechless. Every situation is designed to evoke a specific response, drawing you deeper into its world with a blend of atmosphere, dialogue, and pacing that makes each emotion feel real and immediate.

Pain Threshold - [Formidable:Success] Dolores Dei...

Authority - [Medium:Success] That man on harbour gates. when you face a wall like that, it’s about showing you’re not afraid to push back.

Half Light - [Easy:Success] That sick freak on gates. 

Empathy - [Medium:Success] Deep down you believe, every moment draws out something deep, these feelings are sincere.

Shivers - [Godly:Success] The distant city stands still, its towers reaching for a sky heavy with the promise of rain. A lone man, content in his silence, gazes down happily at his dog. The world seems to breathe with him, quiet, calm, just before the storm. He feels the first cool drop touch his skin, and for a moment, the only sound is the dog's soft panting and the whisper of the wind, the rain has started.

ZA/UM - So, considering all of the spoken facts, let's leave a positive review, shall we?

Hand/Eye Coordination [Godly:Failure] - One moment you're running your finger, like the wind, to the YES button, then you suddenly shudder and press the NO button, leaving a negative review to the game.

ZA/UM - Why?! What is wrong with our game?

Drama [Challenging:Success] - ""Your"" game?

Encyclopedia [Formidable:Success] - The conflict at ZA/UM revolves around the firing of key Disco Elysium developers, including lead writer Robert Kurvitz, art director Helen Hindpere, and lead artist Aleksander Rostov. They claimed they were unlawfully ousted by the studio's new leadership, which took control of the Disco Elysium intellectual property.

Half Light [Medium:Success] - You feel anger building with every word, it's in your chest, crawling through your veins, you find your fists already clenching.

Encyclopedia - The developers accused the management of financial mismanagement and fraud, while ZA/UM's leadership argued the dismissals were due to internal disagreements and financial issues.

Logic [Easy:Success] - Therefore, there will be no sequel to the game, nor any continuing content.

Esprit De Corps [Heroic:Success] - There was that time a cop took too big a bite of his doughnut. One second, he’s fine, the next—powdered sugar everywhere, choking, eyes watering. He wasn’t dying, but for a moment it sure looked like it. Half the precinct tried not to laugh, the other half waited to see if they’d need to step in. Classic.

Disco Elysium - You sit in front of your screen, hands hovering over the keyboard.

Empathy [Medium:Success] - You have enjoyed the game, and you know it.

Volition [Legendary:Success] - Do it. Press the button. It's not betrayal, It's justice

Disco Elysium - And so, despite the love you felt, despite how deeply it resonated with you, there was only one thing left to do. You type it out-a negative review.

Conceptualization [Heroic:Success] - The game was art, no question about it.

Suggestion [Medium:Success] - Brother, you should have had pirated it instead, now the money's gone to them, and you're stuck with regret of undeservedly paying them.

Disco Elysium - You finish your review, the game, with its intricate twists and turns, left you with more than just a sense of sorrow, But Hope. You feel an undeniable urge to dive back into its world once again. The allure, the depth, the unique experience-it's still calling to you, you're not ready to part ways, you want to explore it once more.

Volition [Challenging:Success] - In honour of your will, lieutenant-yefreitor. That you kept from falling apart, in the face of sheer terror. Day after day. Second by second.

Often, I'd find myself with not much to do or in order to move the story forward, I'd choose an option I didn't want to just progress. My last critique is that the music in the main square is so jarring and starts again and again every time you enter that area. Good things about it though: the art style is AMAZING and so unique (the downside to that style is it's not always easy to know where to walk and certain areas are hard to walk through even though it looks like you should be able to).

Really good game(10/10).One of a kind. Ideological delight, very charismatic characters, a lot of inner dialogue between certain aspects of your character's personality. Questions popular political and social ideologies from both sides of political spectrum in a fictional world to the extent that average human will understand and enjoy this intellectual dilemma. Shines a light on certain human perspectives and on the people that believe in them. A game manages to give you a lot of information to process and manages to do this in a way that's captivating, which is really hard when you read wall of text(Game has more words in it than LOTR). Truly a treat I'd recommend it to everyone, but... not from mainstream sources. What makes this game so special is TOP tier writing mixed with in-depth game mechanics. The people that created this piece of art got screwed by the investors in the company they worked for ZA/UM, the group that kicked them out stole their money to buy major shares in the company and kicked the writers out, taking the Disco Elysium IP in the process. Good writing in games industry is becoming a scarce resource and any instance of it should be preserved and given credit, by supporting writers not the corpo-egoes stealing all their work which fuels existing lack of good writing(common theme in culture industry). Other negative comments on this game offer alternatives that don't support corporate greed.

This game is very different than most games that come out, and it deserves credit for that.

That said, I do not think it is a [i]good[/i] game.

[b][u]The Good[/u]:[/b]
[list]
[*][b][i]Setting[/i]:[/b] The only other game that comes to mind being similar in setting/tone is [i]Papers, Please [/i](which is a better game, imo).
[*][b][i]Art Direction[/i]:[/b] While not necessarily ""beautiful"", it is a distinct style that fits the game and stands out.
[*][b][i]Voice Acting[/i]:[/b] The voice acting in the Final Cut is mostly quite good.
[*][b][i]Inner Monologue[/i]:[/b] The different aspects of your character's psyche arguing in your head is by far the most entertaining aspect of the game.
[*][b][i]Kim[/i]:[/b] Your partner is the best character.
[/list]
[b][u]The Bad:[/u][/b]
[list]
[*][b][i]UI/UX[/i]:[/b] Almost impressively bad. I can't think of a single positive aspect to it. Clunky, inconsistent, and confusing. Both m&kb and controller are terrible. Just climb the goddamn stairs!
[*][b][i]RNG Skill Checks[/i]:[/b] Having high skill in something and then having to retry a skill check 4+ times (but not all at once, come back later after you level in between each try) because you have to roll dice is not compelling gameplay. And despite what others say, few of those checks are ""funny"" or ""rewarding"" to fail. Most simply halt your progress and force you to retry later. Swapping clothes/items around using the terrible UI to try and improve your odds is also not compelling gameplay.
[*][b][i]Role Playing[/i]:[/b] Here is where my opinion probably gets controversial. The rest of the gameplay could be overlooked if it offered a robust roleplaying experience, but... the role playing in this game is not very good. Sure, you get to make some dialogue choices, maybe pick between different approaches to a situation, but not in nearly as many as I wanted, and rarely with the nuance I was hoping for. It's not a simple binary option like lazier RPGs, but it's not nearly as many as the glowing praise made me anticipate. I don't care about skill trees or anything like that, ""role playing"" can be entirely about choices and behavior, but there just isn't enough of it here. I felt more like a tourist who could choose who to offend with my dialogue choices. I had a character type in mind when I started playing, and the game repeatedly told me ""no, that's not one of the choices"".
[*][b][i]Writing[/i]:[/b] This is where I really disagree with most people. This game has better writing than a lot of video games, but that is a bar so low you would struggle to trip on it. The good writing is absolutely buried beneath hours of exposition dumps and NPCs droning on and on about hyper-specific fictional history and politics. Speaking of politics, I don't mind that the game is highly political. I [i]like[/i] political games. But I [i]do[/i] mind that it feels lazy, shallow, and particularly unsubtle about it. It makes no sense for some random working stiff to suddenly give you, a stranger, a college lecture on their personal politics, then demand that you also espouse your own. And when you do, you must choose from a small list of hardline positions, or be mocked by the game for ""not picking a side"" (another example of sub-par roleplaying options).

Disco Elysium is extraordinary in many ways, but the original creators have been removed from the studio, and the game is not playable with either of my PlayStation controllers, despite the false advertisement from ZA/UM saying that it is. When I boot Disco Elysium, the game does not allow any input to be received from my DualSense controller as a gamepad. I can only play with a controller by emulating mouse-and-keyboard controls, which is not ideal.

If ZA/UM ever properly fixes its controller support, I'll probably change my review to give credit where it's due for a good update. But for now they're catching the down thumb for wasting my time making a config due to their lack of testing.

In a sense, ZA/UM is continuing to profit from the high quality of the core narrative content primarily inspired by the people they fired, while failing to do its presumably primary duty of providing a fully functional game engine as a medium for delivering the dialogue and story content that was largely created by the people ZA/UM removed from the company.

I mean the controller input should be the literal easiest part of making a bug-free game, to be honest. Leads who allow this are really dropping the ball.

UPDATE: Game doesn't work with an 8bitDo, either. I assume it works with an official Xbox controller, or Steam would surely take its tags away.

FINAL UPDATE: ZA/UM pretended to look into the issue and reported that DualSense works for them, which I have no doubt it an outright lie, and never sent me any of the information I requested about what settings they allegedly used, or what instructions I should follow according to someone who ACTUALLY used DualSense with their game, or anything else that would help resolve the issue. I have therefore concluded that they are either too incompetent or too apathetic to properly solve the issue, and that this game will never be supported on DualSense controllers, despite the false advertisement.

Official Xbox controller did seem to work, but off-brand Xbox controllers, PS4 controllers, and PS5 controllers do not. ZA/UM is as shady as ever to say otherwise.",1729819872,1734532925,False,5,0,0.5141658186912536,0,False,False,False,False,632470,20250114_132033,negative,100

Sail the seas to play it. It is probably one of the greatest works of theory-fiction in this century.

The second half of the game was SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable for me, because it got out of its own way and just lined up back to back bosses nonstop and felt like a completely different game than the slog of the first half. The visuals are beautiful to look at in most areas but the gameplay elements of Souls games that I find interesting are not present in Sekiro, mainly the exploration, creative build diversity options, and level and upgrade systems.

Unlike souls you cant recover currency or level up progress with you die, and there is no stamina so you can infinitely block, run, or attack spam which feels like it takes the tempo out of fights. Mini bosses are surrounded by grunts so the fights aren't as memorable, I've just fought a bunch of ninjas in the same exact method, and major bosses have gimmicks that are supposed to be used to shortcut the fights and they aren't required but they trivialize the encounters. The first boss is riding a horse that you can scare with firecrackers unless you missed the upgrade, the second boss is a summoner whose summons you can dispel with a consumable that I have ONE (1) of by the time I got to their fight, the fourth boss is monkeys that run away unless you use the stealth consumable, even the second to last major boss has two items that take the fight from super difficult to easily manageable: an umbrella that blocks all its fire attacks and a whistle that stuns it so you can do a quarter of its health immediately. The gimmicks bleed into the minibosses too who can have their health bars halved if you can sneak up on them with the consumable or one miniboss towards the end that is more like a duo the second guy can be lured away and assassinated, any spear miniboss is crazy difficult unless you get the spear-counter skill, any ghost boss requires TWO consumables: one to even damage them and another to cleanse the OHKO effect from yourself. These things change the difficulty of a fight so drastically that it feels either oppressive or trivial. This is just a personal preference and doesn't make the fights or combat bad, I just should have expected more of a contrived spectacle fighter style of combat rather than the diligence of traditional souls.

Due to review character limit three nonessential points here have been moved to a comment.

These things would all be fine just personal subjective qualms but my real objection is this game suffers from textbox overload. The text and systems interference reminded me of Monster Hunter except that game is structured into a prep phase and action phase so the player expects learning new things and popups which allows an uninterrupted action phase. If a game has to dump so much instruction about the systems onto a new player then maybe it should fix the system itself to not be so burdensome, or the obvious answer of convey the info to the the player in a more effective way.

The start of this game bothered me to the point I almost quit. The introductory popups happen after the first time you take an action so when you press the block button instead of seeing what it does it stops the gameplay and there's text that says ""hey this is blocking!"" which I would have been able to see if I wasn't inturrupted. Same thing for picking up items, trying to stagger enemies, trying to jump on ledges, and then when I want to figure out if there is a mechanic like rolling or sprinting I can't tell if it's not a thing in this game or if I just haven't stumbled upon it yet because I would only get a tutorial popup after the fact. When still trying to learn the basic controls and mechanics of fighting I have to choose weather to revive after a death or not which I don't know what purpose that really serves, so I revive and get stopped by the popup for reviving that says Hey you can revive, just to get immediately killed again when I close the popup. Then after a few times trying to practice there's popups for ""unseen aid"" which is cryptic so I don't understand what that additional system is yet, then one more death and I'm in a cutscene about  Dragonrot from repeated true deaths and the Rot Essence corrupting the land, I'm just trying to play the game here let me go fight that guy I was fighting. After dying more thoughtout the game random popups about rot essence son and rot essence daughter keep spamming me so I look it up and apparently it decreases the chances of unseen aid. Unseen aid should stay unseen, apparently it had a chance to keep some of the souls you would lose on your next death, who cares about that you lose them all anyway since theres no way to pick them up from your death spot I don't need popups telling me my CHANCE to HALVE that are decreased. Big giant about to grab me so I am trying to time a roll to get out of the way ""Grab Attacks"" popup freeze time and read this cuz you couldnt just have been shown what a grab attack looks like en vivo now I have to close this popup and try to continue the timing of what I was already trying to experience. Every time I pick up an item even if it is a consumable that I already have there is a popup that pauses gameplay that shows me the item and I have to click out of it. I don't want to pick up anything at all now because its just going to be another fistful of ash or pottery shard that I am never going to use. Even when acquiring the item that lets you level up and going through three pages of what the item means and ending the dialogue I KNEW as soon as I took a step away there would be another pause for a text box and sure enough even thought it just told you to level up it's gonna stop you to tell you again, and yet again when you rest at the bonfire to actually put the skill points in, and once more when you click on the skill point menu. Then three more during the process of putting the point in and equipping the skill. Previous souls games were fine with pre-placed text that you could read and then go forward and learn about the mechanic, very disappointing to see this huge step back in the instructional method here.                          I am aware this sounds like nitpicking but gets to the essence of why Sekiro is not satisfying, it's got some good stuff but gets in its own way with bloated systems and inturruptions. The prime example of this is after defeating a boss, where there should be a moment of achievement there are instead two popups about the automatically-collected loot. If the fight is supposed to be intense and the player is on a bit of a rush from victory this is not the time to introduce two main progression mechanics through text. Let the accomplishment play out and have the player go to a chest or something after a few seconds just one second after the fight please. I don't want to read that soon after what should be a moment of triumph with the player's heart pounding from victory. This happens after every single boss and miniboss, and actually robs the surprise from one boss [spoiler] the guardian ape who has a surprise second phase, except I was not surprised because I knew the fight was still going because I expected the text box popups that have happened after every boss up until that point but they did not come up so I knew the fight was still going despite the ""shinobi execution"" marker trying to trick the player into thinking the conflict was concluded.[/spoiler]This boss was the first fight in the game for me that I actually got wrapped up in because it felt like it actually had some soul in it and the mechanics were very enjoyable, so to see a potentially huge moment of surprise nullified due to textboxes is very disappointing to me.

Overall this game has plenty to offer but committed the cardinal sin of annoying me. Sekiro feels like someone trying to copy FromSoft with a knockoff souls game.

When you're fighting a mainline boss, you can get into a really nice flowstate of blocking and attacking and it feels really nice. Unfortunately, the combat doesn't translate well into fighting multiple enemies at once, especially when the enemies can use thrust, sweep, or grab attacks, all of which have the exact same symbol show up but require different responses, which is really difficult to tell when fighting more than one enemy specifically, usually fine against one enemy though, but I really wish it was a different color or something depending on the type of attack, it would just make things so much better imo. 

Basic enemies don't really do a good job of teaching you how the combat works to then use against tougher enemies, most enemies in the game simply aren't able to deal with you just attack spamming them, which only just further incentivizes you to keep doing that. The leveling system is also fairly brutal at times. and works much differently than the other from soft games. That in itself is totally fine, but the way you increase your health is by getting prayer beads, which are dropped by bosses, or tucked away in hidden areas. This is once again, mostly fine, but that means you are going to be underleveled if you don't fight every boss and find every hidden bead, which really sucks late game because every enemy is going to be killing you in one to two hits because you simply just aren't familiar with every prayer bead location, because why would you be on a first playthrough. When I got to the final boss, I was told that your health is supposed to be around 18-20, but mine was only 16. Tying your health and posture to a level system like that is only going to screw over newer players. Not to mention how hard the game already is. 

This is such a fun fighting style that it's a shame I ended up getting too upset at it all, because some bosses are truly great. But there are a lot of bosses that are just not fun at all, the amount of bosses that can apply terror status to you(this game's insta-death mechanic) is surprisingly high, and I really wish they just didn't exist, insta-death just isn't a fun mechanic in any game imo. The prosthetic system I'm very torn on because a lot of them are really cool, but forcing me to continuously farm them just sucks, I really wish you just spawned with your max count every time, when I'm fighting a boss, I don't wanna stop in the middle and go farm, I want to keep trying, but you feel handicapped without prosthetic tools, so the game clearly wants you to go farm, but that's just not very fun for me. The death penalty in this game is also weirdly high, there isn't a system of grabbing what you lost when you died, you just lose half of your money and exp and that's it, it's just gone, there's nothing you can do about it. Which just means more farming if you want to make up for what you lost. All in all it's a fun game, but it's very punishing while demanding a little too much from you.

You're required to beat him to move on. Most bosses have strategies or cheeses you can look up but good luck figuring it out yourself. And even when you know it some bosses are just too damn hard. 

The combat overall just required too much perfection with timing and movement. Miles beyond anything in a souls game.

I don't have the best controller and due to personal problems I'll never have perfect timing. I broke down and had to cheat because I just don't think this game is beatable for me.

Addtionally the mini bosses often times deal equal or even more damage than the actual bosses. They have less health though, which makes these fights rather short and you don't get into a flow.

Its not a bad game, but I stopped playing, because the strength of the game, which comes from prolonged back and forth in sword fights, comes far too short and I don't want to spend hours playing something that I don't enjoy just to get to a great fight again.

I really, really tried to stick with this game. I hated it from the first few minutes I started playing but I wanted to try being patient.

You do not get to create a ""build"" using a wide variety of weapons and armor with unique move sets. There is no stamina bar. You do not choose which stats to level up as you gain experience. It is a third-person action game where you swing your sword at things, but that is the extent to which it resembles a souls game.

With that said, the combat in Sekiro is extremely boring. Unlike other hack'n'slash games like Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden (which the game more closely resembles than any souls game), you have a VERY limited move set to use in combat, most of which is useless. Half the time I find myself mindlessly mashing R1 until it's time to dodge. And the boss fights are such a SLOG. They have WAY too much health and usually overstay their welcome. 

The platforming feels bad and functions bad. Losing half your money and experience on death with NO chance to get it back is a horrible design decision, as is pressing and holding a button to do a universal loot action... which still doesn't pick up the items that are placed in the world. 

And, is it just me, or do all the characters speak painfully slowly? I'm done reading the subtitles and the characters are only halfway done speaking. I don't have this issue when watching anime, so I can only assume the cadence is unusually slow. 

I'll be honest, I didn't beat the game. Not because I got stuck or I couldn't beat it. I just don't want to fight anything using these mechanics anymore.

If you've ever wanted to play a game that punishes you for merely existing, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is your ticket to digital misery. This so-called ""masterpiece"" by FromSoftware is a frustrating exercise in masochism disguised as a video game. Here are a few reasons why Sekiro should be left to gather dust on the shelf.

First off, the difficulty curve isn't just steep – it's a sheer cliff with greased edges. The game's combat system, which fans laud as ""precise"" and ""rewarding,"" feels more like a convoluted mess of poorly-timed button mashing and rage-inducing reflex tests. Every enemy encounter becomes a tedious trial-and-error grind, sucking all the fun out of what could have been a thrilling samurai adventure.

Speaking of adventure, the storyline is about as engaging as watching paint dry. With characters that have the emotional depth of a puddle and a plot that’s thinner than a rice paper screen, you’ll find yourself skipping cutscenes just to avoid the mind-numbing boredom. The developers seemed to think cryptic dialogue and vague lore were substitutes for actual storytelling. Spoiler alert: they’re not.

Then there's the environment. While some players praise the ""beautiful"" scenery, the reality is a repetitive, dreary landscape that quickly becomes monotonous. You'll trudge through the same bamboo forests, dilapidated temples, and snowy mountains, all of which blur into a forgettable backdrop for your suffering.

The game's much-touted stealth mechanics are another major letdown. Clunky and unreliable, they often leave you exposed and scrambling, defeating the purpose of sneaking around in the first place. And don’t get me started on the clumsy grappling hook – it's more likely to send you plummeting to your death than saving your skin.

Lastly, let's talk about the bosses. Each one is a soul-crushing reminder of why you should have picked up a different game. Instead of feeling a sense of accomplishment, you'll be left with a throbbing headache and a growing sense of resentment towards your controller.

In summary, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a tedious, infuriating mess that mistakes extreme difficulty for depth and convoluted mechanics for challenge. Save your time, money, and sanity – play something else.",1722976258,1722976258,False,7,4,0.4931661188602447,0,True,False,False,False,814380,20250114_132046,negative,100

There is some fun to be had but I don't think it's worth the time investment needed to get there.

This game is very difficult and it [b]can not[/b] be played like other soulslikes. You will [b]need[/b] to learn to parry. The games gives you no other options. The window for the parry is very generous but at least for me that did not help as a beginner.
For me it took about 9 hours of pure misery until I finally managed to understand parrying. I can not stress this enough. I absolutly hated the game for 9 hours until it became bearable and then another few hours until I could confidently say to have fun. The only thing that kept me going was the fact I spend so much money on it.
To me this just isn't worth it. It also did not help that in my opinion the first 2 areas are the worst in the game.

It may actually be easier to learn if you have no experience with the genre. Before this I beat Dark Souls, Dark Souls 3 and Lies of P all multiple times and struggled immensely. Due to how different it plays I'd say Sekiro is barely the same genre. That that as you will.

Then when you get to the boss fight there's another 6 minions sitting with the boss and when I finally dispatch them I LITERALLY get one shot by the boss. This trend of having minor enemies with the boss happens over and over again btw. Before I got to this there was also a purple ninja that was impossible to fight and when I looked it up online people said you shouldn't fight him at this stage because you don't have enough health lol.

The phrase people online use is ""hesitation is defeat"" but if you don't know the boss attack patterns yet it's impossible not to hesitate. Atleast in dark souls the bosses are larger so it's easier to see when they are doing an attack but the last 2 mini bosses I encountered where literally the same size as my character and it was really hard to tell when they were doing an attack vs when they were just approaching me.

The combat is way harder than dark souls and reminds me more of a fighting game where you have to do a specific thing to counter each type of attack your enemies do whereas in ds you can either roll, block or parry in response to all attacks. I imagine this game will be fun to replay but my god it's hard to learn. So enemies can do sweeps which you must jump (x), thrusts which you mikiri counter (B when the attack lands), normal attacks which you should parry (LB when the attack lands) and grabs that you need to evade.

Also, the stealth mechanic is a fuck*ng joke. Enemies see you through bushes and target you through walls.

Its not a terrible game at all but it just cannot come close to their real behemoths in the soulsborne series (even Armored Core VI is better than this game). I found the story and the ""lore"" extremely lackluster and disengaging. The world design is terrible I have never played a game with such a disorientating map design like bruh this makes the surge's trash map look decent. Massive amounts of backtracking its sickening (yeah FS titles have that occasionally but wow it is rampant in this game.) The combat is probably the thing I have the least issues with. Am I fan. Not really but in FS fashion its very difficult and punishing.

I feel like Sekiro is a good game that some people could truly enjoy, but take heed on what you're getting into when you buy this.

This is not an RPG, it is not a character builder, it's barely a soulslike honestly. It is a half stealth game half rhythm where the slightest mistake bitch slaps you in about 20 different ways. Every enemy kills you in two hits, making fighting any more then one absurdly difficult. The bosses are surrounded by enemies that you have to fight through every single time you want a chance to fight them. You lose half your gold and XP on death, with a CHANCE of that not happening, which is diminished by each death, making dying even more punishing then before. Saving up enough to purchase something feels like a mountain, exploring to find a bunch of consumables that slightly increase your stats feels unsatisfying, and the combat while fun at times is just so brutal and unrelenting combined with all the game's other tactics just feels like being punched in the balls over and over again.

I might be given jesters for this honestly, people will laugh and tell me to get good, but honestly as it stands this game just broke me, I hope I can come back later and maybe enjoy it and maybe even beat it, but as of this moment I just have no motivation to play it or try and hone the skills I would need for the absurd difficulty curve.

You will get pummeled, staggered, ganged up on and destroyed. That would be all cool IF bigger sized enemies would flinch to your attacks. But they don't, unless you get in a counter hit. Bigger enemies are so impervious to your attacks that it renders the whole attack button useless; the only time your attack does any damage is after a dodge or parry. Parry is key, and yet most unreliable.

Don't get me wrong. Graphics, sound, gameplay, level design - these are all masterful. But the core gameplay, the thing that makes you progress in the game, is horrible. It is all dependent on the one mechanic that is unreliable or at least hard to master.

This brings me to my only frustration with this game. Dare I say that you will spend more time practicing the parry than playing the actual game. This is a gigantic frustration because when I started Sekiro, I wanted to play a single player action game, but now it wants me to play it like a fighting game.

If I wanted to spend hundreds of hours in the lab practicing my moves, I would play some Street Fighter. NOT SEKIRO. I play fighting games and I know a little bit about the rewards of spending time in the lab. Those rewards are largely realised in a fighting game owing to the nature of the fighting game itself; after spending a hundred hours in the lab, the match is over within minutes. You are playing against a character who you could choose to be yourself. There is NEVER A LOSS OF GAINS in a fighting game. You do not lose any items or skill points etc. The game does not make you feel like YOU SUCK.

The reality is that I do not have the time or patience to put hundred hours of lab time in a single player action game, and this game offers me no motivation to even want to get better at it. If I really have to spend that much time to get better in a game, it does not have to be Sekiro.

Sekiro is objectively sub-standard far as the gameplay is concerned, visuals are a mixed bag, being either ok or sub-standard, even after being bored many times since my original review i have had no reason or desire to go back to this game, as the first experience was terrible and indicative of a developer of low standards and care for their product and likewise the opening segment of the game simply drilled that in even more.

sure there are far worse games, but this is why i gave Sekiro a 4/10 as thats the objective score and not my opinion, were for my opinion i would give it a 1/10 because i dont even want to get my $$$ worth, its that bad of a experience to me, even a 1/10 is probably to high and a 0/10 would be more appropriate as i doubt i will ever get my moneys worth, so its effectively paying for grief as a experience at this point and giving a positive score for grief doesnt make any sense, a negative score would be more appropriate so lets just give -3/10 far as my opinion is concerned... again not the worst experience i have had in gaming, but thats why it still has a better opinionated score then many other games id rate much... 

yes i have standards and i aint lowering them, they continue to increase as technology and software gets better, so if devs arent keeping up thats tuff cookies, objectively i cant score their games higher, when they dont want to even push the min bar possible at the time of their games development vs what they could easily do...

so just because a game is believed to be top tier, that is just often a opinion, not a objective fact vs what the software, hardware and DEVELOPER could do, but didnt, with much having nothing to do with creativity or talent, just a question of wanting to do it or not, like deciding if you want to put good tyres on your car or not, its not a talent issue or a time issue and for games often it isnt even a $$$ issue either, yet we still get sub tier products despite time, budget and staff being more then enough to do much better at a BASELINE level, but because it means less is expected the more they do it and get away with it = creativity and talent will never be needed to make a new product that sells and its a easy win release after release long as nobody raises those standards to min levels... 

though if your bringing in a DEI consultant or making the whole game DEI compliant you might just waist 400+ million the way Sony did with Concord or many other games in recent times that flopped hard due to such idiocy and likewise outside gaming in general... 

ORIGINAL review: Starts up in controller mode, you have to change it to keyboard/mouse or nothing works properly = seriously WTF? who did they employ to port this to PC?

Doesn't have complete keyboard keybind customisation either, a bunch of standard keyboard keys are not detected for binding, any decent dev will have a keybind template for the computer languages they work with eg what they always get employed to use, so there is no excuse = which they can just copy paste for each game that includes every standard key found on a keyboard because why would you leave out standard keys found on EVERY PC KEYBOARD IN EXISTENCE? you have to be a moron to do so. Especially since they will obviously need to do this for every dam game they do keybinds for, ultimately you will end up wasting time if you dont have a complete keybind list. so there is no sense writing the code manually each time for each game unless your a moron... you do it once, save it as a template (like with all repetitive stuff) and just modify and adjust it for your needs.

I have done solo game dev, so i would always just copy/paste a keybind template and other common stuff etc etc, normally i just copy the whole thing and just delete whats not needed, saving myself a few hours, including testing since i know there arent any typo's etc in the copy/paste part = i can immediately go to the manual section of code and focus on that... so this sort of crap in AAA games has no excuse, it shows people have no idea what they are doing when it happens and who ever is responsible should be immediately fired, including any QC that ignored it and anyone else that it had to be passed by before being approved/finalised as it directly red flags them as being a wage leech. were if the folks paying the bills dont care = i have no plans to support this dev in the future as = they will do it again and more, so regardless how good the game may be otherwise (i dont know have yet to play it) it basically makes me raise a skull and bones flag on my ship for all future encounters with this devs releases, they clearly dont deserve my $$$... assuming i can be bothered when i have to waste so much time before i can even play the game how i want to even when i get it for free... think i will probably pass, but suggest a skull and bones flag for everyone who can be be bothered to try this game.

due to this in-excusable sloppy joe employed by the studio to do such a simple job, it basically means in order to use my default custom keybinds that work for basically every other game by default, i have to create a new profile, with new keybinds so this one game recognises the buttons i want to use, so i can play using the buttons i want for typical movements and actions, what a joke.

probably not a problem if your a controller user or someone who just uses the typical poorly mapped keybind for these kinds of lazy console made to PC ports, but yea, for over 10 years ive setup and used the same custom keybind setup, which i basically mirror everytime i get a new mouse/keyboard and follow the same map for every game so everything stays in muscle memory or logical to what i typically press on my mouse of keyboard, so it really ***** me of when a dev can so blatantly and shamelessly be bad at their job, how did they even manage to get employed? 

Again having experience myself seeing this level of work which is well below F grade by comparison to a free mod community, its no wonder so many AAA games launch like trash even when they pay people to do the job, they cant even compare to a modder with ZERO CODE EXPERIENCE who is just a novice, reading a mod tutorial onine only to covert game files to TXT, so they can edit them and convert the back = better then this dev at their job = what a joke, thats how bad the folks responsible for this were, even a novice who doesnt know how to code can do a better job... again HOLY COW!.

not sure if i can be be bothered to play this game after loading up yet another lazy port, only positive is i got it on sale, but already feel scammed before even leaving the menu screen.",1708227218,1727312123,False,3,2,0.4647718369960784,0,True,False,False,False,814380,20250114_132046,negative,100

It's challenging, more challenging that any of the Dark Souls games in my opinion. The fact that you have to add parry/block actions to the gameplay really makes the game unique and rewarding after completion. 

Why negative review then? 

Well, for a game that costs 60$, especially from From Software, and ESPECIALLY in GOTY version, you would expect the things to be perfrct. One thing isn't perfect, in fact, it's not working at all - I'm speaking about the controller. Something in this game is preventing from ""normal"" use of a Xbox controller. ""Normal"" meaning - you just plug it, like in any other souls like game and you play, no questions asked. In Sekiro, I had to spend around 5 hours fixing my controller sh*t, searching on Reddit or other forums for a solution. We all know Sekiro has an issue with controller detection, setting THE controller which you are using to be your primary one. In all of those 5 hours I didn't find the solution, I've actually had to develop one for myself. Forum posts helped me find clues but in the end I HAD TO install EXTERNAL software, written by REGULAR people (not devs, like it should have been done). Only after that I was able to play, only after 5 hours of searching and testing.

To me it's unacceptable that a 60$ game of such prestige has this kind of basic problems, unsolved for 5 years so far. So if you are intrested how I'd fix it, check out my guides for a solution.

Other than that, like I said, game is a masterpiece itself. Fights are challenging, even the very basic ones. Maybe you are just a little bit tired with Xbox controller since you have to basically use parry (LT) all the time, and with your finger being a little bit up on your left stick (L) makes it uncomfortable after a few hours but w/e. 

I didn't like some of the boss fights, which basically required some of the Schinobi tools to use. You could do those fights without the tools but it was a pain. Also the fact that you had to tweak your consumables with your right hand on the D-pad made the fights frustrating sometimes.

My main issue remain with controls and the camera. Essentially, some boss fights are too fast for the camera when locked onto an enemy.  Especially if you are fighting close, which is going to inevitable happen in tight spaces. You will eventually lose vision on the enemy and/or the camera will just detach, and you'll end up looking in all directions confused trying to reacquire the target lock. Extremely frustrating, as many enemies will deal a huge amount of damages per hit, and anticipating their moves is critical. It's frustrating, but only in some part of the game. It does work for the most part.

If you can overcome this aspect, you'll find a solid game. The combat mechanism is quite unique. Sekiro has interesting mechanics, beautiful graphics and a good story. It's as difficult as everyone claims; it makes Elden Ring look easy in comparison, as an example. That is because you cannot actually grind mobs to level up, or gear up for a specific boss fight. You can acquire prosthetic and combat arts which are not really game changers for the vast majority of the game boss fights. Because it has been stripped of most f RPG elements, you are actually required to master the art of combat and play the way the game is meant to be played. Boss fights usually can't be cheesed in any way.

While it’s a game from the same minds that brought us Dark Souls, don’t go into it thinking it’s just another Soulslike — it’s not, and I think that’s what makes it so wild.

First off, forget stamina bars and RPG elements; they don’t exist here. There’s no leveling up your stats, no changing armor for different buffs, and you’re not going to find a sweet spot for magic builds or heavy weapon setups. This is pure, unfiltered skill-based combat, and if that sounds intimidating, well... it is. But it’s also what makes Sekiro such a standout.

I’ve gotta be honest: the combat is what’s going to make or break this game for most people. You’ve got one sword and a whole lot of grit, and that’s pretty much it. The core of the gameplay is all about attacking and parrying. It’s super focused, and that’s intentional. From Software knew exactly what they were doing by designing each fight to challenge your mastery of this single skill set. At first, I found it pretty brutal. There’s no fallback to a ranged build or summonings — it’s just you and your katana, one-on-one with whatever nightmare is staring you down. But once you get the hang of parrying, deflecting, and the glorious Mikiri Counter, the combat transforms from punishing to exhilarating.

The posture system is where Sekiro really sets itself apart. Unlike most games where you’re chipping away at a health bar, here you’re breaking down an enemy’s posture. Every parry, deflect, and attack fills up their posture gauge, and when it’s maxed out, you’re rewarded with a death blow that can end the fight or push them to the next phase. It’s so satisfying that I’d argue it’s one of the best mechanics From Software has ever come up with.  One thing to keep in mind: attacking is still important because a lower health bar means you’re going to deal more posture damage. So, finding that balance between pressing your attack and keeping up with deflections is key. It’s a dance, and when you nail it, it feels absolutely incredible.

Now, the game has its lows as well, the steep learning curve is real, and some fights had me on the edge of rage-quitting. But even at my most frustrated, I couldn’t shake the feeling that every death was my fault. The combat is precise, and it rewards practice and timing like nothing else. It’s the type of game where you can come back a week later, fight the same boss, and suddenly it clicks because you’ve gotten better.

TL;DR; If you’re into From Software games and want to test your skills with a fresh take on combat, Sekiro is a must-play. It’s a game that’ll have you cursing your reflexes one minute and feeling like an unstoppable sword master the next. And that’s the magic of it. Absolutely recommended. Just know what you’re getting into — this isn’t your typical Souls game, and that’s kind of the best part. 9/10",1731870635,1731870635,True,149,1,0.9119603633880616,0,True,False,False,False,814380,20250114_132046,positive,100

Hopefully this review gives at least one person a better shot at what this experience is and I will be happy.

So let me start out by saying that I was very new to souls games when I started playing Sekiro. I had just beaten DS3, which I loved and was looking for more of that before Elden Ring came out. This game is NOT like Dark Souls, or Elden Ring, or any of the other souls game. This game is something entirely different than any game you have ever played... This was initially upsetting...

I quickly realized that this game wasn't really what I was looking for and refunded it. After playing many other souls games, I eventually returned to this game with a different mindset. I tried to have patience but quickly became frustrated. I couldn't dodge effectively, I couldn't parry consistently, the hit-boxes were BS, there were too many enemies, I couldn't just over-level... It felt like every part of this game was unforgiving and out to punish you on every level. I struggled my way through the first several bosses in hopes that I would improve, gritting my teeth the whole way. 

The final straw was a boss named Genichiro. This boss is the first true skill test you come across in this game. He tests you for almost every fundamental mechanic in the game to make sure you understand it. It was... impossible... He had soooo much health. His moves were so quick, he had THREE FULL PHASES!!! I thought there was no way I would ever be able to beat him, and maybe I didn't want to at this point.. I died to him countless times.

The really interesting thing about this game is the way everything comes together. There is a point in there where you die over, and over, and over, and over and you don't think you're getting better, but you actually are. The amazing thing about the human brain is that it picks up on things it doesn't even understand that it can pick up on. Slowly but surely, those ""fast"" moves start becoming readable. You start to know what moves transition into what. You start finding openings where you thought there were none. You start to dance with your foes rather than fight them... This stage might take you 10 times, it might take you 100, but I promise if you keep at it your hands WILL eventually learn what to do, even if your brain doesn't.

After enough attempts, something clicked in my brain. If you have ever seen the scene in The Matrix where Neo becomes awakened, its almost exactly like that. You start to anticipate every attack, every move. Its like you can see into the future... This is what the game is trying to bring you to. There is a motto in this game: ""Hesitation is defeat."" There is a reason this is the motto. To truly play this game, you must not SEE your enemy, you must FEEL them. In this moment, I truly felt like a samurai, a shinobi. Once you feel the moves in your bones, then you are ready to really experience what this game has to offer.

I  thought that this game had issues(which it does, just not the ones I thought it had). I thought that the hit-boxes or parrying systems were buggy or wrong sometimes. I failed many times and blamed the game. I eventually watched a video of someone beating the game with a dance pad, and with a blindfold(different videos). This showed me that the game is actually(almost) 100% consistent, it was ME that was the problem. Go watch a video of a boss fight in slow motion and it will show you that the hit-boxes and timings are practically flawless.

Once it clicked, the regular enemies transformed from something for me to avoid and be afraid of to something that becomes a challenge that I want to take on. I slowly learned that everything I thought about the game initially wasn't true. The reason dodging is so ineffective is because this game ISNT DS or ER. It is trying to teach you right off the bat that dodging is not how this game is meant to be played. Instead dodging is simply one of your many tools you have at your disposal.

This game has MANY tools. You might think that that by only having one weapon there is not much variety in this game, but you would be very wrong. All of those enemies that I struggled with had a trick, ALL OF THEM. Every. Single. Enemy. Every enemy in this game has an extremely effective counter, you just have to find it. Between the prosthetics, skills, weapon arts, and consumables there is a solution for any ""BS"" you can think of.

This game teaches you on so many different levels. The start teaches you to parry. The ogre teaches you that dodging is still a tool that is useful for some situations. Gyoubu teaches you that you can parry a lot more things than you thought you could. Lady butterfly teaches you to use consumables(snap seed), the Bull teaches you speed and aggression, the Monkeys teach you stealth, the Guardian Ape teaches you movement and placement, the Owl teaches you to not rely too much on instinct, and so on. I could go on all day about the lessons that this game is trying to teach you, but that is besides the point.

I love all of the souls games, but at the end of the day souls games are memorizing attack patterns and learning how to time rolls, and how to create builds. I feel like this game is much more than that. This game transforms YOU, not your character. New Game+ in the souls games is like a revenge tour of everyone who looked at you the wrong way your first go through. In DS NG+, your character is so much stronger, your weapons are so much better, and you even have a lot of the boss fight patterns sorta memorized so it is easier.

NG+ in Sekiro is an entirely different beast. Yes, your character is stronger. Yes, you have more tools. But the biggest difference in NG+ is you. You are stronger. You have faced all of the trials and tribulations. The bosses you come across will feel like a breeze. Not because you have better armor, but because you now know their moves inside and out. You have become a true shinobi. By the time I played the second time around, Genichiro was no longer a strong adversary, he was pathetic. A fool who was slow and predictable. I knew every move, I could practically do it with my eyes closed.

The Souls games are a test of adversity. They are difficult not to make you mad, but to show you enlightenment. A game is not rewarding if everything is handed to you. Anyone who has ever used cheats in a game has experienced this. It might be fun for a minute, but it is not a lasting joy. For you to truly feel like you accomplished something, you must first overcome adversity. Nothing feels as good as beating a boss that gave you sooo much trouble.

This game is the ultimate incarnation of overcoming adversity. In Dark Souls you can beat a boss, but there is a good chance you will have as much of an issue beating them a second time as the first. What makes Sekiro so special is that when you learn a boss, you learn a boss. They become a tango that you know by heart rather than a battle. Replaying bosses is one of the best things about this game since you will feel how far you came from having your ass handed to you. THIS is the ultimate joy. Mastery over bosses, and if you keep playing, mastery over every single thing in the game. The amount of satisfaction is unparalleled and will leave you wanting more and you just might end up beating the game 40+ times like me because there isn't another substitute out there(Sifu is good).

Suffice to say, I think this is one of the best games ever made and it easily has the best combat ever made. I could go on all day about it. If you like Dark Souls you will like this game, just in a way different way, and it will be harder to get to the place where it all clicks, but good god is it so worth it. So please, REALLY give this game a shot.

It's genuinely been a very tough on-going journey with this game.

Because of how fast the game is, no magic or summons, no grinding levels or equipment, no shortcuts compared to other souls games and punishing aggressive spamming gameplay while rewarding engaging in fights while calm I quickly found out I have an inferiority complex with BPD. I figured this out because of my mental breakdowns, Sekiro is the reason I figured more about myself.

The inferiority complex is rooted with my abandonment issues I believe, I feel worthless when I die and that I'm useless, this kicks off my BPD believing everyone will leave me and pushes me into a mental breakdown.

What Sekiro is doing is aiding me in fighting against my inferiority complex by altering my mentality. 

Instead of determining my self worth on dying, I get happy over the minor self improvement with each death. Especially when I learn a combo string. Set small goals each death to achieve instead of outright winning, it helps ^^

If a strategy fails, it's the fault of the strategy and doesn't mean you're worthless or flawed as an individual.

""I'm crap at this game, I'm stupid."" upon death turns to ""I figured out how to deflect 2 of the bosses attacks. I can work towards deflecting the third attack, I'm making good progress.""

If I slip up and start melting down I journal the thoughts to reassure myself that I'm not worthless and that this is just my inferiority complex trying to force it's way into my brain.

Defeat will happen in this game, it teaches you to replace the hate from losing with love and admiration you got from self-improvement.

I also learned the brain applies everything you learn better upon resting, so taking breaks if it becomes too much will actually make you better!

- Extremely fine-tuned and satisfying gameplay consisting of switching between being offensive and defensive on the fly. Knowing how to block/deflect properly and when to use your arsenal of prosthetic tools is key to conquering this game's combat, and becoming the best shinobi you can be.
- To get absolutely skill-checked on numerous occasions, especially in your starting hours. This game is hard, and contrary to what the name says, you will die more than twice. However, with enough practice, you'll find that enemies and/or bosses that you first thought to be impossible to defeat grow to become some of your favourite encounters in the game.
- A reinforced brick wall in the form of a certain red-eyed individual wreathed in chains. Trust me on this though, the game really opens up once you manage to break through and emerge victorious.
- Absolutely gorgeous environments to run around, explore and do battle in, as well as an amazing soundtrack to accompany them. The abundance of eye and ear candy in this game is phenomenal, and I will forever mourn the lack of an official Sekiro soundtrack on Spotify.
- A touching story interwoven throughout the game's progression, as well as a memorable cast of characters that you'll grow to care for to an emotional level. There are multiple endings and character side quests, but for the sake of keeping things spoiler-free, all I'll say is to be wary of some of the choices you make throughout your journey.
- New game plus! If you ever want to re-experience the game without resetting all your collectibles and stat buffs, or you want to try going for a different ending, just boot up a NG+ after completing the game. However, be warned that certain enemy stats, like their health and attack power, will be slightly buffed, and will continue to scale up until the seventh playthrough inclusive.
- Post-game boss rush modes and a menu to refight bosses you've encountered throughout your journey. A nice post-game challenge mode for players who are seeking for it, and a neat and accessible way of replaying some of the game's incredible boss fights without having to go through a new game to do so.


[u][b]Miscellaneous details to be aware of:[/b][/u]
- This game is naturally locked at 60fps. If you'd like to unlock the framerate, there's a really nifty mod available online that'll allow you to do so, as well as some other game-altering features should you wish to make use of them.
- The game is, at least from my experience, very well optimised. I don't recall running into any performance issues whatsoever in my 100+ hours of playing, despite running it at basically max settings on what is a relatively mid-tier PC. In any case, I still recommend checking for available benchmarks online to gauge your expected performance before purchasing.
- The game plays very well with keyboard and mouse. I unfortunately don't have any controller experience to share, but I can personally vouch for the fact that you can get good with a KB+M setup. Just make sure to tweak the keybinds to your preference if the default control scheme isn't working out for you.
- For all you completionists out there, most of this game's achievements outside of those for the separate endings are tied to either boss defeats or acquiring upgrades and skills. There are a few miscellaneous achievements that aren't necessarily tied to progression, but you're bound to run into them naturally unless you actively go out of your way to avoid getting them. All in all a simple game to 100%, though it will take multiple rounds of NG+ and a bit of grinding to get all the achievements.


[u][i]Overall thoughts:[/i][/u]
I didn't know what to expect when I first booted up the game, but I did not expect the levels of satisfaction and adrenaline I would experience playing this game. There were many moments where I deemed a challenge too hard and unfun to bash my head against, and considered throwing the towel in. But each time, I persevered, and looking back, I'm so glad that I did, because with each victory, I could feel pride at the fact that I learnt and got better with each attempt, no matter how long it took. 'Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice' truly forces you to get good, but when you do, you're rewarded immensely with opportunities to engage in combat that is basically akin to dopamine heaven. An easy 9/10 from me, and a must-play for anyone who's ever dreamed of becoming an acrobatic shinobi purging rats from the war-riddled lands of ancient Japan.

I also remember losing my first 5h of playtime to my mother opening yet again the laundry machine and oven, on top of my PC, the fridges, etc.; a killer load for our electrical system. My UPS had recently died, my PC went off during a save and it corrupted. Don't get me wrong, my 5h were less than 1 when knowing where to go and what to do, but it still scorched me so bad I keep setting hourly backups of all the active games I play! 😂

For reasons I can't even understand, I'm five years late for this, but it's time I get around to reviewing Sekiro.
And what better time than now, right after playing through it again? Shoutout to Chad of Astora for the video about the intricacy of the maps in From Software's titles, as that reminded me how wonderful Sekiro is.

[h1]Ikuzo, SEKIRO![/h1]

The main character, Wolf, is a servant to Kuro, the Divine Heir, who is blessed with the ability to grant immortality to those who serve him. An ability that shapes the world of Ashina into obsession, considering it's so rare. Said blessing, is the lore explanation for why we as the main character can die and resurrect at least once during a fight, but also at the familiar idol checkpoints in the game when failing, but not without a cost.

Being a shinobi, Sekiro can't win a strength contest but excels in ability and agility. Sekiro's mobility is one of the best parts of the game. The grappling hook feels amazing, and the wall jump, plus grab ledge ability, really gives complete freedom of movement.
Gravity is not deadly anymore, and fall damage is a lot more lenient and can be canceled by anchoring where possible with the grapple, regardless of height.

The world's interconnectivity, heavily inspired by Dark Souls 1, is second only to the aforementioned, and Elden Ring. It's possible to explore and do so much before even completing the first objective after the prologue. 

The stealth mechanics and the ability to assassinate from behind walls, above, or behind enemies are so fun and well executed! The game is better at assassin's-creeding than any of the last games of the series.
Combined with all the shinobi tools you're given, unlockable skills, and shinobi arts, there is a good amount of customization and build-making available while keeping all the options viable.

Lastly, the collaboration with Activision has given us a great introduction and tutorial.

[h1]Stagnant Flaws[/h1]

Although set in feudal Japan, Sekiro is surprisingly varied when it comes to its environment and design, with plenty of cultural nuances. It's sad that for a foreigner many remain obscure because of a lack of cultural understanding.

Sekiro is extremely transparent with its story and is probably their most story-driven title to date with plenty of cutscenes and dialogues. It leaves little to speculate, and descriptions take the place of instructions for usage, more than pieces of a puzzle.

Compared to Western tropes, it seems to me some subjects are dearer to the Japanese narrative, and are often included in many mediums. For example, the cyclicity of a world/universe can be seen in Dark Souls, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Dragon's Dogma, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and Evangelion which I can think of. Much like the Moonlight being present in almost all From Software titles in one way or the other, some subjects and mechanics are bound to be improved and reintroduced in new ways. 
The subject Sekiro focuses on is stagnancy, accompanied by a familiar mechanic that had not been seen since Demon Souls, abeit less punishing.
I mentioned all this because, for the longest time, the Dark Souls community was stuck in the misunderstanding - caused by a flawed translation - that the flow of time for those games was ""convoluted"" when the actual translation was ""stagnant"". 
Stagnancy in Sekiro is so excruciatingly explained that in the process, it gives a better idea of what that looks like in Dark Souls.

In Sekiro, my favorite example that sent me into a rabbit hole of research is the character ""源” used for the name of an area. Although translated correctly, it also translates to Minamoto, the most powerful and important clan out of four great clans that dominated Japanese politics during the Heian, Kamakura, Muromachi, and Edo periods, who in the Genpei Wars crushed the Taira clan, which the Ashinas were related to.
It's a small history nuance, and not as major as the translation flaw in Dark Souls hindering the understanding of the world, but sad nonetheless as a history buff, when the main setting of the game is Japan, and we could have been exposed to more things like this.

[h1]Mastery is victory, hesitation is defeat.[/h1]

I consider myself a From Software veteran, but there is one boss, my favorite actually, I would say I know like the back of my hand. I can easily tell exactly what it'll do next, and take perfect spacing from its attacks.
I don't say this to boast myself, but to depict a picture of what killing any and all bosses in Sekiro is like. Mistakes are heavily punished, while ability is greatly rewarded.

Learning a fight and its pattern is, for lack of a better example, like learning a track on a rhythm game. It's not just about knowing the song, but knowing how to execute it to a level that will allow you to complete it.
When you learn how a boss moves, the objective shifts from using their windows to damage them, to using what they do against them.
Deflecting attacks will slowly chip away at their posture, giving you the opportunity, if well executed and with enough aggressivity to perform a death blow on a boss with almost all its vitality intact. At the same time, taking some of the vitality down will make their posture recover slower during breaks.
Not all attacks can be deflected, some must be avoided and others must be countered, and it's this intricate dance you do with each enemy that is the magic of Sekiro.

This rhythm, the bosses' ability to dodge or tank after consecutive hits, and the moveset of your attacks being a 4-hit combo with a long recovery on the last move, make the game a souls-lite, although it misses many key components of the genre.
The moveset combo idea worked well in Bloodborne, fast-paced and with low stamina usage, and made its way into Sekiro. The new posture system and rhythm of the boss attacks solve both the attack and roll spam Dark Souls 3 suffered from. All this then made its way into Elden Ring, making it the peak of their work yet.

I never lost a fight without understanding where my mistake was and learning from it, and I was never victorious without feeling like I could do it again.
Sekiro's punishing yet rewarding gameplay is what made me celebrate audibly for defeating a boss I had already defeated in the past, just because I didn't learn it so well at the time, but mastered it now.

[h1]Memories of Extraordinary [...][/h1]

After winning GOTY - might I remind everyone against Control, Death Stranding, and Resident Evil 2 Remake - almost a year after, a patch was released that added both a boss replay mechanic and three boss rush modes that award different outfits for Sekiro.
This is something I always felt was missing, and I'm glad made its way into it, although breaking a LOT of mod compatibility in the process. This also added some asynchronous online functionalities, like player ghosts and messages.

Although seemingly more restrictive at a glance, Sekiro offers some of the best visuals, gameplay, and movement in gaming.
It all builds up to the best reward for skill and ability of any of the From Software titles, and it makes me hope the true ending is nothing but a nudge to a sequel that would be more than welcome.

Other than that for me, easily an 10/10 game, if you're an die-hard fromsoftware fan like me you'd know the characters, worldbuilding and fights are just top-notch bar none.

The most appropriate phrase to use for this game.
It's tough and demanding, but I've never felt more satisfaction with gameplay and beating bosses after countless attempts.
This game has opened me up to Soulsborne games despite being the outlier of the bunch, its differences are what defines it and makes it more engaging allowing you to feel like your skills are actually improving!

I abandoned it before reaching the first Boss.

Sekiro is a difficult and challenging game. The first time, my mistake was approaching it as if it were DS3 or Elden Ring.
Once I understood that being aggressive and deflecting at the pace of each enemy was the key, I became addicted to the combat the game offered.
Each enemy has its own rhythm, its most efficient way of being defeated and its unique mechanics that make the combat the best I have ever played.
he best for me were the bosses. Each boss was like a puzzle that I had to solve. And the challenge they presented was increasing. But never so frustrating that you don't want to keep trying.
At first I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the game, because Genichiro had me as his pet xD
But it was so satisfying to beat him and also find him again at the end of the game to destroy him in a matter of 3 or 4 tries. That's when I realized that the game encourages you to play better and better. And that's something I love.
El diseño de los mapas y lugares donde se lleva a cabo el juego es precioso!
Amo la cultura japonesa, por lo tanto ame recorrer cada sitio
La banda sonora no fue algo que destaco tanto como en otros juegos de FromSoft para mi. PEro igual no me quejo para nada al respecto.
The story is good and entertaining.

As for negative things, I think I can only say that repeating the headless monkey as a boss is quite poor and adds nothing to the game in my opinion, that battle is forgettable.
And that most of the items in my opinion are quite unnecessary. I think I once used a Damage Boost and very occasionally Pellets if I was on the verge of dying on a boss.

In short, an excellent game in my opinion, one of my favorites.

[h1]I recommend it a lot.[/h1]

Sekiro is a soulslike/rhythm game that provides you with sword clanking ASMR and some of the most rewarding gameplay that makes you feel like you've mastered a fight once done it, so much that a boss fight that once takes multiple attempts to beat can be done first or second try on a second playthrough, and it still feels good.

So if you're a fan of the soulslike genre like I am..

[h2]Pros:[/h2]

- [b]It has the least bs in any 'hard' game I've played, ever. Meaning that deaths actually feel deserved.[/b] What this means, in other words: Hitboxes make sense, you don't die randomly in ways that feel like you had no control over, and the mechanic of being able to revive also means it's *absolutely* your fault if you die twice to the same thing, in the same way.

- [b]The feeling of beating a boss in this game is unparalleled.[/b] It very rarely feels like you got lucky or that you barely made it. Why? Because the game punishes you every time you get away from a fight to heal or even breathe, and encourages that your playstyle involves always standing right next to your enemy until you've perfected the kill. You either lose by using up all your healing items, or win by barely even using anything other than your sword.

- [b]It starts out as what seems to be the hardest souls game ever, but once you learn the basics, it can also feel like the easiest at times. You're adapting and getting good.[/b] This is a pro on its own that follows the previous one because you're constantly being reminded that you're improving by how a boss fight plays out by the time you win. You won't get this from your parents, so Sekiro can provide a good amount of this positive feeling for you.

- [b]ASMR.[/b] Ambience is good, sounds are good, and most importantly, fights often feel cinematic in the good, non irruptive way.

[h2]Cons:[/h2]

- [b]I lied, this is a pro too.[/b] What makes Sekiro a solid, amazing game overall is that it has the least cons in any soulslike. Most of them are the same, like the times the camera decides to give up and betray you, and the obligatory gimmicky/obnoxious fights. My point here being that Sekiro has the least annoying elements out of them all.",1714680225,1714680383,True,12,0,0.6148837208747863,0,True,False,False,False,814380,20250114_132046,positive,100

This game is also notoriously difficult, as is the theme with other FromSoftware titles. However, rest assured that once you begin to understand the combat system and it finally clicks, the game becomes much more enjoyable and defeating difficult bosses ends up feeling way more rewarding!

Before the final boss, I was quite sick. I tried to beat it a handful of times before almost up for the day. Then I said ""alright, one last try for today."" And that one last try was enough for me to finish it.

In most difficult bosses, I would feel a sigh of relief after defeating them. This time, I felt victorious and overwhelmed. 

9/10

The 1/10 withheld is because the game doesn't fully show the skill trees from the get go, meaning you cannot plan ahead with your build and become more masterful of the tool you have. This particularly applies to the prosthetics skill tree, which can make you more lethal if you apply them to your combos. 

P.S.

There's no shame in watching how other people defeat the bosses, but it's extremely important to not cheese the bosses. You will never learn how to deal with them, nor you'll improve as a player.

Game has multiple endings and they are very obscure. Other than that the game has plenty of content to keep you playing and doesn't overstay it's welcome like many others.

After playing it, I have to agree with both. There is a brutal learning curve to overcome, and some bosses will test your patience to the limit. However, I wouldn't say it is far above the Dark Souls games in terms of difficulty, and if you go into this game with a good mindset, there is nothing impossibly difficult that will be able to stop you.

The combat system is the heart of the game, and it's probably my favorite one of any game, at least when it comes to one-on-one combat. Clashing your blade with another warrior just feels exhilarating. Every parry, counter, or dodge you time correctly feels great and makes for a very good flow of combat. There are no breaks during a fight, just constant action until you can finally run your blade into the enemy to end him, or fail to do so and perish yourself.

There are very few ways to customize your character, and there are not many different ways to approach fights. So you mostly have to play how the developer wants you to play, which means mastering the game mechanics and learning the enemys attack patterns.

To me, there is no big negative point to this game. There might be some specific enemies, attacks, or status effects that I found annoying, but really not something big worth mentioning. I just wish it was longer, with more areas to explore. There isn't much secret content to explore, and the main content isn't super long either.

The posture + vitality system is the absolute best choice for a game like this. It's incredibly simple, yet has so much room for depth. Not a single boss felt like it was out of place. Even some bosses which do not wield weapons at certain times still felt like they were a part of the game. Were they all well designed? I don't really think so. The main story bosses that you face are obviously the ones that got the most attention in the game. You can tell because they are the bosses that make you feel as though you are learning them rather than slogging through another fight. The first boss I would make that label for is [spoiler] Genichiro [/spoiler]. He is the first brick wall I faced, but through the several hours of fighting him I could tell that I was slowly improving. The fact that a boss like that is in the game with any confetti boss is mind blowing to me. In the game there is an item you can receive called confetti, and in order to beat some of these bosses you need to use confetti on your sword to deal any damage. First of all, I don't understand how Miyazaki ever let that idea get through. The confetti is a rare drop, so I don't understand why so many bosses require it. Not only are these bosses locked behind a rare item drop, but they also suck from a combat design standpoint. So many of the hitboxes are bigger than they actually are, and for one particular boss named Headless that has a slow sword, the visuals on them are so off that I literally can't tell where the sword is half of the time. Sometimes it's underground, sometimes the sword is so shaky that I can't understand it's trajectory, or sometimes I can't tell whether the sword is about to hit me or not. Ontop of that, the boss also limits your movement which just felt annoying. I can't believe there are five versions of this guy. Thankfully those bosses are completely optional, but beating them does grant you some nice rewards.

I also want to talk about the movement of the game, because I think it is has some of the worst design choices I have seen among the three games from Miyazaki. First of all, Why would you ever add a seemingly 1 second delay to a run + jump? Half of the time when you intend to run and jump off of a ledge, the jump just cancels because you end up running off instead. It's not even like i'm jumping late either. At certain points the game will help you not run off of the ledge by keeping you on the floor, but those walls still seem to fail because the time between input and jump is so large. And to top it all off, the jump feature is a requirement for almost all bosses in order to not get hit by some of their moves. God forbid you recognize early that you have to jump to evade, only for your character to still be running into the guy you are trying to kick away from. And even when you do successfully run and jump into an enemy, often times you will end up passing them instead of kicking them. I think the grapple hook is a well placed feature in-game, but I think it needs some adjusting in terms of the camera work. Way too many times I look in an unintended direction while grappling. I really like the movement options in the game, but they need more fine tuning because they feel like they are getting in the way more than helping.

Onto combat, I felt like this is where the game really shines its brightest. The combat is absolutely phenomenal. Incredibly precise and satisfying for every battle. The sound design and animation for every battle is absolutely gorgeous. They both mix very well with the combat, giving you several unique options for how to counter each boss. The game progression is great, and even with some frustrations at the beginning of NG+, it still felt like the game was waiting patiently for me to improve. One small gripe I would give is that prosthetics eventually become useless once you hit lategame. If you don't have all prosthetics unlocked, then you are locked out of most upgrades that could potentially be of use for lategame enemies. I would relax on the upgrade barriers a bit so that you can still get max upgrades on some of them without needing all prosthetics. Combat arts also kind of suffer from a similar issue, but I think thats more of me not taking the time to learn them properly.

As always, the stories from Fromsoftware are great. I was really liking all of the characters that we saw, and one great thing was that I could actually understand the story, unlike the other souls games xD. Each area within the game is great, and makes the game very unique and interesting to follow, especially Ashina Castle. The final boss in the main route is incredible, definitely one of the best I have played. It's a culmination of everything you have learned up until then, and it's displayed masterfully. I wish that games would stop doing this thing where certain bosses are locked behind certain routes. I wish I could just play through all bosses without worrying about which route I'm taking. It would be good to add an option to create an additional save file so you could play both routes and their bosses. There are very few games where I feel like I want to replay the entire game over again once I already beat it.

This is a good game with some very strange flaws that don't make sense to me. Another great achievement by Fromsoftware and Miyazaki. Most of the issues I noticed were fixed in Elden Ring, so I'm glad to see that they saw them and fixed them.

Below I've put some thoughts on what makes this game great (and some comments about why it may not be a ""perfect"" game), but TLDR is that this game is a great choice for anyone who likes other FromSoftware games, and may be a good choice even for those who don't because of its differences from the traditional ""formula"": 

[h2] Pros: [/h2]

- The story. In comparison to some of FromSoftware's other games, I found Sekiro's story to be simple but much easier to follow than the other titles. The story progression feels natural, you get plenty of background on character motivations, and the game does a good job offering different endings to the game which have their own ways of wrapping up the story. This game doesn't have as many ""NPC quests"" as some of the other Dark Souls games, but I also appreciate how these are easier to follow than other Souls games.

- Combat. While parrying/deflecting is not a unique mechanic to Sekiro, this game puts it front and center and ensures that by the end of the game you'll feel like a true expert swordsman. On top of this, the game offers other weaponry besides your sword which can be a nice addition (but certainly not a replacement) to your blade. The game also offers a skill tree which rewards you in a similar way the souls games would for killing enemies, but instead of Sekiro having a level, you simply put your XP towards skills. 

- Swordsman fights / duels. The game is truly at its best when you're facing down a boss or miniboss in a 1v1 situation. Bosses wield a variety of weapons (and come in a variety of sizes) in this game, but some of the most adrenaline-pumping moments will come from fights against another swordsman where your reaction speed and thoughtful but quick decision making will be put to the test. Sekiro also ensures that bosses as you progress become more and more difficult, but in a way that you feel at least mildly prepared for (usually by placing enemies with similar techniques or gimmicks along the way to a boss). This is something FromSoftware generally excels at and it shows here. 

- Environment. Sekiro does not have as many environments as Elden Ring for example, but the game does a very nice job of ""recycling"" areas as the story progresses, and allowing you to return to areas to explore previously unavailable content (usually collectibles or secrets). The game also rewards you for exploring with Sekiro's movement abilities and taking the time to see what the map has to offer will save you lots of trouble with some of the stronger bosses later on.

- Average playthrough time. I appreciate Sekiro being a bit shorter because in today's world of gaming we're seeing a lot of AAA companies add ""bloat"" to games which simply waste the player's time. This game feels like every hour you spend in it is meaningful in some way and is bringing you closer to beating the game. It took me around 30 hours to finish my first playthrough and for some it may be as quick as 20 hours. This is a really nice amount of time for me, and for those who want more you can always do NG+ for the other endings and other secrets!

[h2] Cons: [/h2]

- Large / monster-sized boss fights. This is a sticking point for me in just about every FromSoftware title. I find that in general fights against larger enemies tend to be less about skill and more of a waiting game (or a gimmick fight). Sekiro does a better job than the traditional Dark Souls titles for the most part, but I still found myself less interested in these fights but not as frustrated as some oversized bosses are in Dark Souls. Some may not consider this a con since they encourage a different playstyle (less parrying, more dodging and poking generally).

- Lack of build variety. This is just a fact of the game and it's the trade-off that you make when playing a game where you are a particular person versus an ""avatar"" (player-driven character). In Sekiro you can only play as Sekiro, therefore you must use Sekiro's weaponry and skillset. There is variation in your other shinobi tools and the skill tree, but if you don't find his sword or prosthetic weaponry enjoyable then the game isn't really for you.

- Some things could be clearer. There are times where you can progress out to a certain area and be ""locked"" from progressing further until you do other significant story events. These aren't as obscure as other Souls titles but can still require a google search or a little more running around than you may want to do. 

- Small enemies protecting or blocking a mini-boss. There are at least 3-4 instances that I came across where a miniboss was surrounded by small enemies. Your options here are as follows: Charge in and try to fight all of them at once (this will almost always fail because of sheer numbers), sneak around and stealth kill each small enemy one by one (this will get the rest of them engaged usually which requires a dance of de-aggro, wait, stealth kill, rinse & repeat), or openly attack the small enemies as a group and ignore the boss until they're dead (works ok but you'll likely spend healing which you may need for the miniboss). This is a small gripe and not a huge deal, but worth noting.",1720571740,1720572008,True,2,0,0.5454545617103576,0,False,False,False,False,814380,20250114_132046,positive,100

The skill tree customization offers various combat arts and techniques, enhancing your fighting style. Stealth mechanics provide a tactical edge, letting you thin out enemies before engaging in intense one-on-one duels.

I came from bg3, and heard that this game was not as beginner friendly. Turns out, after playing 200+ hours of turn-based combat, dos2 is super intuitive. If you like the combat in bg3, you'll love it in dos2. The only downside is there's no jumping!
I also heard that the companions weren't as fleshed out. I disagree! I LOVE the companions in this game -- there's just no cut scenes. The dialogue is so so so good though and the humor is amazing. I also think that bg3 was a huge improvement for Larian's graphics, but after playing dos2 for so many hours, I genuinely think the game looks great and has a lot of graphical similarities to bg3.

Also, the music is better.

The quest writing and characters of BG3 are certainly more mature and more polished, but OS2 feels like I am sitting down with a bunch of friends back when I was a kid to make up a story on the spot.

I've spent just less than one thousand hours on this masterpiece which means its my most played Singleplayer game in my adult life (admittedly some hours were playing multiplayer with friends but still). Now there's no way that I'm going to be able to list all the good things about this game in one review, but I'll try my best and highlight some really good aspects to hopefully encourage anyone reading this to give it a go. 

Pros -
Firstly, the music in this game is AMAZING. It either sounds completely badass for fights or incomparably elegant for exploring the world. There were so many times during my many playthroughs that I had to make the decision of either humming along to the music or letting my ears fully embrace those beautiful instruments. 

Visually this game is stunning, the details in the world and the particle effects of abilities/spells look so well done and make it feel so satisfying when you cast them. I also really appreciate that this games movement is very freeing for a turn based RPG. I've always disliked those games where movement is restricted to like a chess board with squares. Having your characters quite literally being able to move anywhere feels so much better. 

Next up, the story. [b]EVERYTHING[/b] has lore in this game. If you love reading and want to read pages and pages of lore, character backgrounds and potentially hundreds of books scattered across the game, then you can most definitely do so. But its not forced onto you. Most books that you find throughout the game aren't necessary to progress, and a lot of the time there will be an option to resolve problems by fighting if you prefer a little more action. Its completely up to you how you want to play. 

Lastly, I want to talk about the character creation. The character creation in Divinity is phenomenal. Obviously you can change the look of your character to how you want but more importantly, there are 10 Skill categories that you can allocate points to. You can mix and match them together and pair them with *mostly* any type of weapon in the game. The combinations you can make are endless. For example:

Want to be a persuasive fire-wizard that uses daggers instead of the usual staff/wands?
Want to be a non-confrontational thief that escapes his enemies by turning the floor to ice causing them to slip?
Want to be an archer that fires love arrows to temporarily make his enemies fight for him?
Want to be a cleric wielding a giant axe who can explode corpses?

Well you can have all 4 in the same party! I could talk about this game for hours but at the time of writing this these are the aspects of the game that came to mind. Now I'll talk a little bit about some very minor cons that don't put the game in any bad light but I feel are good to know anyways.

Very Minor Cons - 

Gift Bags: [b]If you don't care about achievements then move onto the next con[/b] -- Gift bags are the developers way of giving their own made mods for divinity. They are free little game mechanics that you can choose whether to enable in your game or not. (I highly recommend that you [b]do not enable any of these for your first playthrough[/b] as some make the game considerably harder/easier). Some of these settings are incredibly useful but the issue is since these are acted like mods, achievements are disabled if you enable them, so you will need to replay the game without them in order to gain any. I wish the devs would have actually implemented some of these into the base game rather than adding them as mod-like settings after.

Inventory: Inventory management in this game could be a liiiiiiittle better. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the inventory system, but there are definitely a few QOL changes that they could have added. One example being the ability to name bags. Throughout the game you will pick up individual bags that you can place in your inventory and put any item inside. They are incredibly useful in tidying up your inventory and reducing clutter, but these bags cannot be named. So you will end up having to repeatedly look inside each bag to find out which bags have which items. Additionally, when crafting stuff, if an ingredient is inside one of these bags, the crafted item may appear in the bag of the ingredient instead of just appearing at the bottom of your inventory for you to sort out. Again, not exactly a game-breaking problem but definitely slightly frustrating when you have lots of items in a bag and now need to find a random crafted item amongst them all.

Other than whats listed above I just wish the game never ended honestly. I want more cool spells, more races, more talents, more fights, MORE OF EVERYTHING. Truly a really incredible game, please give it a go because the developers deserve it.

I got into DOS2 after playing BG3 because BG3 was probably the best RPG I ever played in my life. I wanted to see if DOS2 had that same magic. In short, yes it does. But I wanted list some pros and cons comparing to BG3 (obviously knowing BG3 came out 7 years after DOS2) for those in my shoes.

Pros

- I liked the story here better than BG3
- VA is just as good as BG3
- Combat system is better than BG3 simply by virtue that it is a home grown system and does not have the same restrictions given that BG3 is based off of D&D 4E. The AP, memory slot, and skill cooldown based on turns in DOS2 is MUCH better than the BG3 combat system built around Action, Bonus Action, spell slot, and especially the ""once per long rest"" restrictions that I loathed in BG3
- Combat relies more on crowd control than bursting down enemies for big damage. Feels more strategic
- The loot is more fun in DOS2 than in BG3 especially if you are a stat junkie. Seeing ""big number go bigger"" on your gear is fun. 
- The unique loot that has cool set bonuses and special effects are far more streamlined, and unlike BG3 you are far less likely to accidentally miss some crucial loot needed for endgame builds by doing something silly like Long Resting too much or accidentally talking to the wrong person with the wrong party member
- Respeccing your party is far easier, you can just add/remove points in specific skills rather than starting from scratch every time like you had to in BG3 

Cons

- While the story is better, the lore and characters are better in BG3. Not really a con but I thought I would mention it here. 
- Mild Spoiler: you have a total of 6 companions (in addition to an optional custom origin character) that you meet in Act 1, and you can switch them out whenever you please. However when you move to Act 2 whichever companions in you party ARE YOUR PERMANENT COMPANIONS and you will never be able to change them out again...and the game LITERALLY NEVER EXPLAINS THIS TO YOU. Such an odd and dumb choice by Larian here, I am glad BG3 changed this. 
- If you thought the auto pathing in BG3 was bad, DOS2 is far worse. Clearly Larian did some major improvements there
- Line of sight in this game is ridiculously janky. Characters apparently cannot tilt their heads up to look over waist high obstacles or down to look below knee high guard rails. This will kill a few fight for you almost guaranteed
- Casting AOE spells in CC is a pain because the cursor usually wants to auto lock on a target 
- Build crafting is far less reliant on loot than in BG3, but also has a lower ceiling since you are not using gear with broken extra abilities to combo with builds. If they ever make DOS3 I would love to see more of the unique loot that they had in BG3 while keeping the frequency, diversity, and power of generic loot in DOS2. 
- While certain quest and loot lockouts due to irregular game pathing are far less common in DOS2 than in BG3, it still happens. Be cautious.   

Overall, if you liked BG3 I can't recommend DOS2 enough. It truly scratches that same itch.

EDIT: after playing for tens more hours, I have some more cons

- no jumping means that for every single time the game want you to take a path with even the slightest  break in the ground, you have to jump through hoops pulling our your transpiration gloves or other spells to get your party to just FREAKING TRAVERSE THE GAME it's such a bone headed design oversight

I was told this was the best game to play after Baldur's Gate 3, and as I get to the end that was totally right. It fully feels like a stepping stone to get to BG3 and is also just fantastic to play. 

Pros:
- Honestly having so many levels feels very satisfying even compared to BG3 where you only got 12
-The fighting is just really fun. Took a second for me to get used to the small changes (like turn limits, source, and no resting needed for spells), but it was certainly well done and had so many possible moves/spells.
- Characters are great (Sebillle ily), and a fun plot that I enjoying playing out
- Voice acting is very good (Sebille VA ily)
- There's so many options for armour that all have different ways to boost you, so many different designs, ability combinations, sets to match etc. (not being able to level it up is a little unfortunate, but I think it makes sense for the game so I wouldn't say that's a con)
- Making your party specialize in different areas and have different abilities is so fun (which realtes heavily to the fighting, but in general it's just great)
- the support abilities are so much better here than BG3 - partially because I didn't need to worry about wasting a spell slot, and because some only took 1 slot which would be all i was left with, but also they were just legitimately better

Different than BG3 (not really pros or cons, just differences when comparing a relatively older game to a modern masterpiece):
- The characters (side characters and main ones) don't have nearly as much depth in this game even though what we get from them is great
- no cutscenes (again, these points aren't giving any negative points in my eyes, just stuff that could make it even better if it came out now)
- Levelling up doesn't come with as much customization and changes
- Aspects of the story (and side characters) are both a bit more convoluted and simple, as well as just harder to follow - still good
- There's no long resting, and short resting (using bedroll) is only for restoring health. Honestly besides missing the camp that aspect was actually more convenient
- Oh yeah there's no camp clothes, and costumization options due to no cutscenes, but there's also more armours and lacking informal clothes doesn't do anything
- there's no dice rolling which I missed even though it was kinda nice that I didn't have to worry about rolling a 1 lol
- Moving and actions are counted in the same 4 moves (the amount you can walk per move depends on character) which I can see being better or worse. I like both

Cons:
- The levelling system can be a little annoying and I ended up needing to look at level maps which I guess is elaborated on in my next point
- The game doesn't feel like it guides you enough or gives you quite enough freedom (to be clear this is a grievance, but isn't nearly as bad as that makes it sound, just something I encountered a couple times). There were times I would accidentally stumble into enemies who were too high levelled, but they were already aggravated (or I couldn't talk my way out) so I would have to load before I met them and just avoid them until I could reach the correct level. There was also one major time that I didn't know I had to trigger events in a specific order (or a couple times I thought something would trigger another event so I avoided it only for it to not matter - like going on that kids boat in act 1) and what I needed to do wasn't really said which led to me kinda fucking up a part of the main story... Also led to me not getting resolution on Peeper and reloading continuously to save him for half of Arx only to realize he had no relevance after the arc he got introduced in and I had just not casted Spirit vision where I was supposed to
- The persuasion (or I guess this applies to tags and just general interactions too) aspect can be annoying, maxing it for the main character is the move, but it can still be annoying just because occasionally your allies will be the ones to be spoken to, especially after battles if you aren't the closest one to the NPC. Then you have no persuasion and are lacking your tags which can lead to another issue. Also had to reload a couple times to bring my MC closest to the NPC before a fight ended or to intentionally trigger conversations that my allies accidentally did

Anyway I'm sure there's many more things I could add (and I probably should've waited until I actually finished, I'm sure the end is great) especially to the pros, but if you enjoyed BG3 and see this review, yes it's a fantastic game to play after BG3.

But somehow never played any old school classic ones like Fallout, KotOR, Baldurs Gate or any of like that.

Maybe it's the lovingly crafted world, maybe its the variety of approaches to the gameplay, harkening back to a time when games were more immersive and less linear.  Or maybe it's something special about the way Larian makes their games.  Either way DOS2 has become one of my most enjoyable gaming experiences of my whole life and a game I would say may rank among the finest ever made.

Truth be told I bounced off of DOS2 maybe twice before I actually got it to finally click for me.  I tried it for maybe 10 hours 2 and a half years ago, got a bit into Fort Joy.  Gave up, quit for a year and decided Id try again.  Began a new save and got back into it pretty hard, fell in love with the first act, put 40 hours in exploring and loving the game.  Got to Act 2, felt overwhelmed and out of place and just desired to go back to Fort Joy and dropped the game again for an entire year.  Picked it back up on a whim and began right back where I left off.  Had a buddy help me respec my characters a bit and I was in love.  

Divinity Original Sin 2 is a classic RPG.  The main game play functions similarly to Dungeons and Dragons, where it is split up into segments where you explore with your characters, talk to NPCs, gain quests, and do whatever RPG stuff you want, steal, buy things, explore the games world and then obviously get into combat, the other chunk of the game.  DOS2 is played like a tactical turn based RPG somewhat similar to XCOM but not entirely.  The game has no rigid class system like Baldurs Gate or Diablo.  Characters can freely spec their attributes however and if they meet the requisite skill for a move, they can use it.    While my initial reaction towards the way the games armor system works was negative, it grew up me very well and I now see it as a way Divinity puts itself apart from other games in its style.  

The story itself is charming if not unremarkable.  It is full of wonderful characters however, hilarious moments and excellent side quests, whereas the overarching plot follows more in line with a typical chosen one RPG affair.  It serves its purpose very well without being so present it becomes boring.

I only just beat it recently, in co-op with 2 other people. I had a blast.

We played in a team made up of a warrior, assassin, archer and fire mage.

Some parts worked rly well in co-op, all the arena fights, item and character managment felt smoother when you only had to worry about yourself. You technically could go your way and progress alone but if a fight started with tons of enemies you would need the help of your allies.

It did take us almost a month of playing almost every evening, it is a lot of commitment to ask for. 

Alone I imagine the experiance would be a bit faster and smoother, since you would have control over everything when playing alone.

The game is fairly dialogue heavy, so might not be everyone's cup of tea. The quest system at times confused us and we werent sure how to progress and if we even can progress. We did what we could, but still felt like we missed plenty of things, this game is pretty big in terms of content, a lot of achievements to get too. A game for potentially tons and tons of hours.

I do plan to eventually revisit it, in order to focus more on the plot and make other choices, i would also want to play around different classes. In co-op I played mainly as the ranger , and experimented with skills in act 1.

Compared to the latter, the game features a lighter atmosphere and a slightly different system for spells and actions, opting for turn-based ""Action Points"" (AP) costs - which regenerate each turn - rather than slots you regenerate by resting; I personally found this system more enjoyable.
The second main difference in the combat system is that it's based on two types of armor, physical and magical, which are both independent from one another.

The plot, divided in 4 acts spanning about 100 hours in total, is interesting but, in my personal opinion, hard to follow at times due to some narrative choices by Larian (this is evident - IMO again - especially in some quests in Act 4).

Featuring cartoon-style graphics, the game is pretty light on the system, making it really portable.
The soundtrack is also pretty nice, with some forgettable tracks as well as tunes you'll be thinking about in your daily life.

What really set this game apart from many others is that, not unlike BG3, it always offers creative ways to avoid combat and/or to beat powerful enemies and challenges, one just has to find them.

Last but not least, it's possible to not only host and join multiplayer campaigns but also to create your own campaigns if that's your thing.

What. A. Ride. 
I am a bad player. Not really used much to CRPG - really, one of the first i played. 
I failed. Over and over again, restarting game completely, rolling new characters several times. Trying different cmbinations of classes.
Then, i finished my character main story quest at hour 200,and final game about 20 hours laters.
Full playthrough took me around 80-100 hours. 
Game is 'hard'. requires you to know what you are doing at many occasions. tutorial doesnt really prepare you on what you are about to face. there were times i was frustrated, when i was nearly throwing mouse across the room.
Story wise? It was perfect. Perfect. down to the last minute detail. 
I am writing this review minutes after finishing the game. What the ending 'did to me' is hard to put into words. I am moved. In world of ""AAAA"" games (which i think it stands for long scream into the abyss), with same developers creating 'same games' over and over again, dulled, empty and repetetive, I was given something authentic. Something with ""soul"".
Buy this game. give it a try. Even if, just as me, you wll need to go on vacation from it for about a year. it's worth every peny. No, it's actually worth more. as a 30 years old dude I was given my childhood back.
Dear Larian Studios. Thank you. Thank you for this absolute perfection of world. thank you for allowing me to once again feel joy between long days of overhours at my job. You raised the bar so high, that I fear I might not enjoy anything else in a long. long time.

If you experience frequent crashes and have the Razer Synapse installed, unlink the game in the software parameters. It completely fixed the issue for me.

So, after playing to and loving BG3, i've become curious of Larian's previous works. I've heard people saying that BG3 should have been called DOS3 and i can perfectly understand their point, because they have A LOT in common. In both games, you start as a prisoner on a ship that crashes and are saved by a mysterious voice. There are a lot of little examples like this where the two stories are quite close. Some BG3 companions are directly inspired, or a mix from two DOS2 companions (i see Astarion as a mix between Sebille and the Red Prince).

But the resemblance doesn't stop there. Both games have no real huge travels between maps, they include 3 or 4 big zones absolutely packed with content, the last one being a city. So yeah, they're pretty alike (excepted BG3 has of course a lot more bells and whistles, like cinematic scenes for more or less every NPC encounter, there are none here). That hasn't been a problem for me as i found both games to be excellent, but at times i felt like they haven't been  very subtle in the way  they copied stuff from DOS2 to make BG3.

This being said, DOS2 might be inferior from a technical perspective but there are some aspects of the game that are better. DOS2 is tougher. I played both in tactician difficulty and i found DOS to be much more of a challenge. I'm now at the beginning of the final act and there have been times where i wondered if i would be able to go on  (you can't lower difficulty after picking tactician), because some fights are really tough and requires that you make the best use of the topography and of your skills. Not saying that BG3 is an easy game, but winning in DOS felt more rewarding to me.

There are also a ton of items. It seriously felt like i was playing a looter shooter at times. This is due to the fact that  there is a skill that gives you a chance from getting a magical item from basically any container in the game. Even better, a part of the loot is random. It adds an element of surprise and i prefer that to fixed loot tables. You can really finetune your gear to make exactly the character you want.

If you're looking for something to play after BG3, DOS2 can definitely scratch that itch, if a more modest technical presentation isn't an issue for you. If you can get it for 12 or 13 bucks during a sale like i did, it's a complete steal.",1718208625,1721221882,True,10,0,0.6564225554466246,0,True,False,False,False,435150,20250114_132026,positive,100

After the death of the spiritual leader, there is a merciless hunt for all users of the magical energy known as Source, to which you belong.

And who are you? That is exactly the question. As in most RPGs, you can create your own character, including race, profession, and various stats. Or you choose, in my opinion, the significantly wiser option, and become one of the pre-made heroes who complete their own, carefully constructed, personal tasks, waiting for special adventures in the world.
And what heroes they are! The elf Sebille, like other members of her race, can eat human flesh and thus access the poor victim's memories. It can reveal pieces of the story, or perhaps learn a skill. The Red Prince is the ruler of all the lizards, although he is currently suffering from the slight inconvenience of exile. And the various reptiles he encounters in the world will either love him or hate him. Lohse is possessed by a demon. Fane is an undead skeleton that can only move between humans when it puts on someone's face instead of a mask.

The ability to re-spec if you make mistakes in builds is really forgiving. I made mistakes, but lived with them for fun. 

I am only 40 hours in and I can't wait to:
i) Progress further into the game
ii) Run the game again with different builds/characters

Tips:
i) Read/listen to dialogue and use your gut.
ii) Build a team covering as many different skills as you can.
iii) Be yourself - I don't like stealing, and every tip list said to pickpocket, but I did not because that is not me.
iv) If stuck simply look over quest details, talk to NPCs and explore more - there will be multiple avenues open to you that you have not yet realised.
v) The game is bigger than you think.
vi) Save very frequently.

Though what makes this game stands out, is the spectacular voice acting and combat mechanics which gets you thinking how to maximize your turn, and trying out different strategies that just somehow works. Though there are certain character builds that outclass others and are easier to play while dishing out insane dps (I'm looking at you, ranger).

That said, I definitely spent 100+ hours on the game (just not 240+ - that's insane), and admittedly toward the end in Arx the game definitely got a bit long in the tooth. But overall this is a big step up from the first game, which I still somewhat enjoyed but many elements hampered said enjoyment. For one, the story and characters here are a giant step up from the 1st game - I actually genuinely care about some of my companions now, and the game's build-up as we go from Fort Joy to Reaper's Coast etc is well-done narrative-wise. Equipment upgrade is also quite addictive - I love getting a divine item that is more powerful than what I am using. But there is a downside to said system also which I'll mention later. And gaining levels in this game makes a substantial and palpable difference to your combat abilities, unlike many other games where level increase is just a bunch of meaningless stat gains but with little in terms of feeling the power boost. Some of the fights are also really epic, like the one in the Blackpits fighting to save Gwydian - that was amazing to see all the flames bursting across the field. And the insanity of the Paradise Down area is another highlight. 

That said, the game often also misses the mark, which is a shame because I mostly enjoyed what is here, but these problems are just too big to ignore:
- the game weirdly gives next to no experience to solutions that do not involve combat, which means that peaceniks like me, when we come upon a combat situation, invariably become so level- and experience-deprived that it is basically impossible to continue. In fact, experience points are way too rare in the game, meaning that I was forced to reload back to Fort Joy to basically restart and to fight characters I would normally not choose to kill. But alas, the game really doesn't give me much choice due to it rewarding combat experience points over everything else, which is a major, major flaw. It really takes away from the role-playing aspect in a huge way, since I cannot fully play the way I want to.
- even when I already chose to do way more combat just to gain a bit more experience, the game is just way too hard in some areas, like when I first got to Arx. I was only level 18 but enemies were level 20, and it means there were swaths of areas I couldn't go to. And when I decided to pursue the sewers/dwarf quest, I realized later that this locked me from away from crucial experience points I needed from several fights with Nemesis enemies. So, once again, I had to reload all the way back to when I first got to Arx. Sigh - this is just tedious. And before you said I don't need to do that, well, yes I did, because I barely made it to level 21 toward the end game, and that final battle is *not* easy whatsoever. So every experience point counted, which is just not good design IMO.
- Inventory is also a real pain. Yes, I know that you can move multiple items if you use a controller, but I was using a keyboard and mouse, and boy moving a whole bunch of forks and spoons to sell is incredibly tedious. And swapping suits of amors also - there needs to be secondary sets you can pre-equip, because otherwise I need to keep tediously swap between individual pieces. My character has a set that maxes Lucky Charm during exploration, but he needs a different suit for combat, so every time I have to swap out each piece back and forth. Just a complete waste of time.
- Arx gets too bogged down on things that I felt didn't seem to matter anymore, like the Devourer suit. That suit would have been better accomplished on the Nameless Isle than in Arx, where already too many things were going on, and it was hard to keep track of things. It started to feel like busy work rather than me feeling invested. True, Fort Joy was also incredibly overwhelming at first, and that was also a negative, but Reaper's Coast I felt struck a near-perfect balance - it was so fun. 
- And speaking of Arx, that final dungeon and those weird puzzles and resurrecting bots with next to no explanations....seriously?? It was incredibly frustrating and anti-climactic. Really brought the whole experience down I feel. 

It is still a much better game than the first game, which I only gave a 6/10 to (that's still a thumbs-up from me), but I cannot ignore its myriad of issues to give a super strong score, so I'm going with a 7/10. I enjoyed it a lot, but admittedly the frustrations also really mounted while I played, especially having to restart due to my characters lacking experience points and levels due to the game's preference in rewarding combat. I still haven't played it yet, but I really hope Baldur's Gate III improves upon all this, because underneath this is a really fun and addictive game that needs some overhaul to really shine.",1707593834,1707593834,True,3,0,0.5421291589736938,0,True,False,False,False,435150,20250114_132026,positive,100

Turn-based battle system is relaxing and helps the player have fun.

An Astonishingly beautiful soundtrack.
Great Aesthetics.
Stellar writing and stories, well... most of the time.  

It's far from perfect though:
The combat felt worse than DOSDE1 due to the armor. In the first game you immediately started with an elemental combo, now everything is blocked by armor, so my mage character felt far less useful after summoning its minions. And combat definitely feels tedious even on classic difficulty, so I think I'd only recommend playing it in Story mode. Difficulty increase doesn't make the game harder, just slower. Actually I ended up lowering to story more halfway and I still felt that its a bit slow.

Too many micro management stuff in the game:
- Like going back and forth to a source fountain to refill, 
- Too many lootable containters that are empty and are a waste of your time.
- Inventory management is a nightmare, and while the auto-sort in the character's inventory is nice, containers should have the same, and most importantly a 'store all crafring ingredients' button would be a welcome feature. 90% of my game-time is just dragging items in and out of the inventory. And I barely used most of them. But OCD be damned I can't help myself I had to check every container, because ""What if it has something important in it?""

Too many simultaneous quests, I hate it when games dump over 20 quests at me at the same time. Pacing developers, pacing!

Lots of bugs: 
- Ryker first addresses you as if you attacked him even if you didn't.
- The entire Seed of Power questchain: Can't talk to Daeyena at the first encounter. Then at the second encounter if you have spores on you while she detonates the magister they will explode and she will get hit thus turning hostile. etc, etc.
- And many more I am not gonna list. Luckily most of them are not game-breaking and minor inconveniences.

Some A.I. Issues:
	Characters will avoid damaging surfaces, but will step on every single trap on the floor, even if they themselves spotted them. Even worse, Sir lora who's not in your control, and moves periodically(even in turn based mode, he just goes off repeatedly, teleports back, runs away again), had commited self-delete for me many times by running on and off of traps repeatedly.

Story (Spoilers)
[spoiler]Some quests are quite nonsense. For example I played Sebille, and Saheila doesn't make any sense to me. If you refuse to take the Mother tree's place because you don't wanna be a slave again, she attacks you. Then she asks you to kill the mother tree because the mother tree enslaves people. And then she thanks you for freeing them and says she hopes to see you again, even though she's freakin blind. 
	I think my biggest issue is that this game REALLY requires you to either be omniscient or to go to the wiki if you wanna have the best outcome for quests. For example, I encountered the Shadow prince before I went to the mother tree, and I ate his heart, only to realize that it was a quest item. Stuff like this happened a lot.

Long version:
-the first thing you should do is map Q and E to rotate camera left and right (the default is Del and End)
-expect *a lot* of pixel hunting, even when the game tells you you've spotted something.  The ""highlight loot"" key (alt) does not highlight containers such as chests, crates, baskets, tree stumps, trophies, etc.  Preparing to cast any AOE spell eg Bless highlights a bit more, but still not everything. 
-the engine is buggy.  Expect long battles where the enemy takes control of your characters (eg via Madness) to crash.  You'll sometimes find you can't attack a very close enemy with your Bone Widows.  The sound stops working quite a bit.  Items disappear (particularly if you equip loot directly from a body/chest rather than from inventory).  
-although the combat is mostly fun and the best part of the game, there are many battles which obviously weren't playtested for fun, ie those where enemies keep coming back to life or respawning, or take control of your characters via Madness or turning them into a cow etc.  In particular in the last Act, with the Lizard Embassy, Arx Arena Dream Portal, and Source Puppets in the lever puzzle room repeatedly taking away player agency.  
-inventory management is a nightmare, a good start would be the add search like in Pillars of Eternity. There is no multiple select/transfer option between PCs or NPCs.  There is no way to identify unread books.  There are no multiple loadouts for eg combat vs crafting/bartering/identifying modes.
-management of skills is also cumbersome.  Simply being able to display more than one taskbar at a time at the bottom would help (and being able to easily drag skills between task bars), as there are a massive number of skills, arrows, grenades, scrolls etc.  
-the quest log is a joke.  There is no sorting by location or type of quest (main, side etc).  The quest log is very poor at giving you guidance re what to do next, and you will be repeatedly having to use a walkthrough if you want to actually complete quests.  The issues go beyond things not being obvious, to being obtuse.  
-the crafting is deep but also cumbersome in terms of finding stuff in your inventory, and again you will need a walkthrough/guide
-the story and lore is long and confusing
-a number of mechanics are a waste of time: I never used the teleporter pyramids since I got Teleport, Tactical Retreat and Phoenix Dive.  Weapons and armour have durability but never take damage.  Lockpicking is never required if you have the skeleton Fane in your party.

Overall I would recommend it, but it is an 8/10 game, due to its many issues.  I certainly won't be playing it twice.",1706471459,1706471591,True,6,0,0.5387471914291381,0,True,False,False,False,435150,20250114_132026,positive,100

Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition is nothing short of a triumph in the realm of role-playing games. Building on the already stellar original, this edition enhances the experience with polished gameplay, refined mechanics, and an expansive narrative that truly immerses players in a rich fantasy world.

One of the standout features of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is its intricate storytelling.

The tactical turn-based combat system is both challenging and rewarding. Each encounter requires strategic thinking, with environmental interactions and character abilities playing pivotal roles. The introduction of new skills and combos keeps battles fresh, while the ability to manipulate terrain—like igniting oil or creating surfaces that affect movement—adds layers of depth to combat strategy. The Definitive Edition also introduces improved AI, making enemies more challenging and engaging to fight.

Graphically, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is stunning. The hand-painted visuals bring the vibrant world of Rivellon to life, with detailed environments and beautifully animated character models. The sound design complements this with an atmospheric score and well-voiced characters, further enhancing the immersion.

The Definitive Edition includes various quality-of-life improvements, such as a revamped inventory system, better character customization, and refined user interfaces. These enhancements streamline the experience, making it more accessible to newcomers while still providing depth for seasoned players.

Divinity Original Sin 2 stands tall as one of the greatest RPGS ever made, this game deserves more recognition and credit. The world and setting(s) they have created in this game are truly fascinating and are incredibly diverse. The locations remind me of a fantasy game, however it has its own unique twist and flair to it.

The characters in this game, especially the companions are incredibly well written and very worth your time learning and understanding. Each companion has a different reaction to the actions you commit in this world and they all have their own usefulness and negatives in combat. It is not so simple as ""a mage can heal but not do other mechanics"". You have full control over how to spec your companions and character, I made a necromancer knight and it was incredibly viable throughout the whole game and never felt pressured by the game to doing something else. 

The story in D:OS2 might be my most least favourite aspect, it starts of very strong and engaging, and peaks at act 2 with branching story lines and engaging content and characters that make you keep playing late into the night wondering what is going to happen. However, during the later acts of the game, the story definitely starts to weaken a fair bit, the plot becomes confusing and wrongly paced and it becomes a point where you say to yourself ""I just want to get this done with now"". The constant puzzles and drawn out battles in act 3 just to drag out the playtime were not helped by the constant backtracking for certain items that game had not clear were necessary to progress the story. However, the combat and exploration is still incredibly rewarding and fun, so it evens out. If you are one to get burned out quickly, this game will not be for you at all.

Overrall, D:OS2 stands tall as a great game which has an incredible amount of quality content, paired with well-written characters and an interesting map. However, certain hindrances such as the fall off of the story, and the weirdly paced later acts and drawn out puzzles and battles must be noted.

As an RPG, you can feel that Larian blew this game out of the water.

For a small backstory: 
Larian wanted to make Baldur's gate three, but Wizards of the Coast(the owners of D&D) didn't have any real evidence that Larian could MAKE a good Baldur's gate game, so Larian made Divinity: Original sin 2.
Wizards saw the success of D:OS2, and went ""yeah, you can make Baldur's gate 3"".

This game feels good to play, just slightly awkward to get used to at first. A lot of the systems aren't very intuitive and there is a lot of menuing around to figure out what kinds of characters you can make.

I also have minor gripes about how leveling in this game works because it's too easy(if you like exploring, like me) to run into areas you aren't supposed to go to yet and die frequently to higher level enemies because you came unprepared for a fight... and underlevelled.

It's not that bad on a second playthrough, but if you are blindly playing DOS2 I strongly recommend having a friend who has played it, or a guide online to avoid falling into the many, many, many pitfalls that i fell into. 

Still, with all that being said, great game. 2nd and 3rd act are definitely weaker than the first but still enjoyable enough for me to replay this game again and again.",1735795713,1735795713,True,1,0,0.5238095521926879,0,False,False,False,False,435150,20250114_132026,positive,100

and let me tell you that i thoroughly enjoyed Divinity 2, it holds up VERY well to the standards of 2024.
The story is complex and there is definitely more content here than BG3.
I can see why people say divinity 2 is better than Baulder's Gate 3.

The graphics are 9.8/10. Only one spell casting animation is a bit weird but whatever.
The story is 9/10. There is a lot going on and it feels a bit overwhelming at times due to the sheer number of quests that stack up in the quest log. Its worth noting that the ending was satisfying.

My only complaints are that the inventory management and crafting can be bit tedious if your an OCD type. This is one of those things that got improved in BG3 thankfully.

Overall i give it a 9.5/10 - DO NOT buy the DLC unless you plan on playing it again.
I can see myself doing another play-through of this game in the future.

Act 1-2, solid 10/10 with good pacing , artfully weaving between fun and serious tones.
Act 3, is a 8/10 because progression grinds to a crawl with a couple of loose ends getting tied as you make your way into Act 4 which is a 7/10.

[h1] Combat [/h1]
Its a race to drop your opponents respective armor down so you can start stunning and Crowd Controlling (CC) them, whittling their health all the way to zero. Unfortunately, the AI is very much aware that if you have high physical armor that prevents physical stuns like knockdown, your magic armor will be vulnerable and you'll end up skipping your turn because you are frozen like a Popsicle or electrocuted.

Cyberpunk 2077 launched as a monument to everything wrong with game development, rushed, buggy, ugly, just mechanically broken. It was called every name in the book, cashgrab, garbage, etc.

However, these devs show so much love for this game, its incredible. The past 4 years have been spent making the game better day in and day out. Polishing and refining their original vision for the world of Night city. 

What we have today is a spectacular single player experience, an incredible story with heavy themes. With great gameplay to boot.

This game is genuinely what i consider to be the best Single player game of all time.",1724670918,1724670918,True,371,8,0.9403608441352844,0,True,False,False,False,1091500,20250114_132033,positive,100

This game means a lot to me, and has seen me through some rough times. The world is comforting in a way, even though the oppressive atmosphere of the Corporation ran world is weighing down everything. Much like real life, you find comfort in the people you meet along the way. These characters are written so well that it's impossible not to resonate with at least a few, in their beliefs or struggles. How they view the world and how they wish the world were different. It can sometimes be very heavy stuff, this game holds no punches. 

Immersion is king. No game matches the feeling driving in Night CIty listening to the radio taking in the vibe. Night City is the most well crafted City in any game, period. The sense of scale is mind boggling, and whether you're walking among the skyscrapers or the skyline is just on the horizon the artistic design and scale is nothing short of a masterpiece in itself. Not one part of the map feels the same, and there will always be new things around the corner each playthrough. 

The gunplay is not often talked about enough, and I think that's a shame. I think Cyberpunk has some of the richest and most satisfying shooting in any first person shooter recently. Cyberpunk gives you the tools and the variety to become an unstoppable killing machine, but you have to put yourself together. The combinations in gun types and projectile types mixed with melee weapons, mixed with the plethora of absolutely ridiculous movement abilities on top of the dozens of overpowered cyberware that's been recently added to the game it's no wonder you're a legend in the city. Guns all have many different reload animations,  which I personally love when a FPS has this. Seeing the same reload animation an entire game kills my immersion. 

The soundtrack is one of my favorites, both the score and most of the radio. There are some really good songs that are guaranteed to raise your adrenaline given you've got the volume up, and you should. The sound design is superb, as an audiophile I can't NOT have this game's volume maxed out. Some of the music will no doubt ruin your accuracy from all the head bobbing, especially in the Phantom Liberty expansion. 

The amount of support this game has gotten post release is impressive, and I'm not including getting the game up to an acceptable point. The game shouldn't have released on past gen consoles, and there were a lot of issues I had with the game immersion wise that have been nearly fixed entirely. There's some bugs here and there but it's not going to ruin your experience anymore. This game is a feat. With how much is packed into this relatively small space, Night City, making it the most dense urban environment in games I understand that bugs will happen. 

This game is beautiful, not just visually but in what I've taken from it. This story and especially Phantom Liberty have hit me so hard it'll stick with me for forever. And with how varied the gameplay can be, with how many different endings there are and an almost unlimited modding platform Cyberpunk 2077 isn't leaving my PC anytime soon.

Maybe Cyberpunk 2077 had a shaky start, but as of this version and all the revisions, with the expansion, this game is an absolute masterpiece.

I've loved the Cyberpunk 2020 setting for three decades, Transmetropolitan is one of the best graphic novels ever and I've watched Fight Club more times than I can count. I didn't expect to see all of them reflected in the game. I still didn't expect I'd love Cyberpunk 2077 this much, but it totally got me.

These days, basing a massive game (with a major budget) on 30+ years of old RPG lore just doesn't happen. I was falsely under the impression that 2077 would be a soft reboot, since the attitude of ""this much backstory could be a burden in attracting new players, so let's just scrap the old lore"" is so common these days. (Fuck you, James Workshop.) I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that pretty much all of the stuff from Cyberpunk 2020 is still canon and even a major part of this game's main story.

If you want maximum appreciation of the setting, in the Steam version's bonus content you can find a complete scan of the Cyberpunk 2020 original rulebook. While most of this time capsule will make you appreciate the details of 2077 worldbuilding, I'd recommend at least reading the short story/adventure ""Never Fade Away"", originally published in 1988.

The last time I got this emotionally invested and immersed with a game's story and characters was probably back with Mass Effect 2. The Witcher 3 got close, but I like Cyberpunk 2077 even more. The saying ""In Cyberpunk, there are no happy endings"" is quite true. Half of the possible endings had me in bittersweet tears and the rest were so cripplingly depressing they should come with a medical warning. As it should be. Case never saw Molly again.

One other thing about this game that I don't think has been emphasized enough is the music. It's also something that nobody's dared to do. Instead of licensing famous old 80s/90s hits for nostalgic emotions (like pretty much any movie trailer these days), the music in this game is original. There's something closer to 15 hours of new music and radio stations in this game and it's performed by actual artists working under Cyberpunk pseudonyms, with the titles and lyrics in-universe. Hell, they've even recreated some of the bands and tracks referred to in the old RPG books. While this is already quite insane, the soundtrack just bangs with really diverse genres represented, from black metal to obnoxiously cute lazrpop. I don't think anyone has ever done musical justice to a fictional setting this well. 

This would be worth the price just so you can ride your motorcycle around the massive, detailed city (or ride the metro, I guess) while listening to the radio stations and soaking in the ambience of Night City.

This game is one massive love letter to one old cult RPG and it's so weird that it isn't actually made by greedy corpocunt suits who just want to chase profits. Work of art, really.

Cyberpunk 2077 has achieved one of the greatest redemption arcs in gaming history. It’s a stunning, immersive RPG that delivers on almost every level—but for me, it’s still missing that elusive something to make it a perfect 10.

What I Loved:

    Night City is Unmatched:
    Night City is the real star of the show. It’s vibrant, chaotic, and alive in a way few game worlds manage to achieve. From the neon-lit alleys of Japantown to the corporate opulence of City Center, every district is meticulously crafted. With improved AI, denser crowds, and enhanced environmental interactions since launch, the city finally feels like the bustling dystopia it was always meant to be.

    Deep, Immersive RPG Gameplay:
    Cyberpunk 2077 offers incredible freedom in how you approach the game. Whether you prefer hacking your way through systems, stealthily taking down enemies, or going in guns blazing, the gameplay accommodates multiple playstyles. The new updates and DLC bring even more depth to the combat and skill trees, making character builds more engaging than ever.

    Phantom Liberty DLC - A Game-Changer:
    The Phantom Liberty DLC is not just an expansion—it’s a revitalization. Set in Dogtown, a gritty new district of Night City, it introduces a tense spy-thriller storyline packed with twists, political intrigue, and moral dilemmas. Idris Elba’s performance as Solomon Reed is phenomenal, adding even more gravitas to the stellar voice acting. The DLC also brings significant improvements to the base game, like overhauled perk systems, vehicle combat, and more engaging side quests.

    Memorable Characters and Storytelling:
    Cyberpunk 2077’s story is rich and emotionally impactful. V and Johnny Silverhand (masterfully voiced by Keanu Reeves) have one of the most compelling dynamics I’ve seen in a game. The game masterfully weaves personal struggles with larger existential questions about identity and humanity. The Phantom Liberty storyline adds even more layers to this narrative brilliance.

    Technical Redemption:
    At launch, the game was plagued with bugs and performance issues, but it’s now in a state that lives up to its potential. CD Projekt Red has gone above and beyond to address the criticisms, making this one of the best post-launch redemption stories in gaming history.

What’s Still Missing:

    Lack of True Player Agency:
    As much as the game emphasizes choice, the main narrative often funnels you toward specific outcomes. While there are different endings, your decisions throughout the game don’t always feel as impactful as they could be.

    A Sense of Longevity:
    While the open world is packed with detail, it sometimes feels like a stage rather than a truly living world. Interactions with NPCs and side activities, though improved, still lack the depth to make Night City feel as reactive as it looks.

    Missing That ""Perfect 10"" Factor:
    For all its brilliance, the game still feels like it’s just short of perfection. Maybe it’s the lack of a revolutionary mechanic that changes the genre, or maybe it’s the way some gameplay elements (like crafting or economy systems) feel secondary. It’s hard to pinpoint, but there’s something intangible that stops it from being the definitive RPG experience.

Overall Thoughts:

Cyberpunk 2077 is no longer a cautionary tale—it’s a triumph. The Phantom Liberty DLC and continuous updates have elevated the game to masterpiece status, delivering one of the most immersive RPGs of this generation. The world-building, storytelling, and gameplay systems come together in a way that few games manage. However, as polished and engaging as it is, there’s still something missing—a spark or a layer of depth that could make it truly flawless.

Pros:

    Night City is a stunning, immersive open world.
    Deep, versatile gameplay with incredible build options.
    Masterful storytelling and memorable characters.
    Phantom Liberty adds an exceptional new storyline and gameplay features.
    A technical redemption that few games have pulled off.

Cons:

    Main narrative choices don’t always feel impactful.
    Some open-world interactions still feel surface-level.
    Missing an ineffable ""wow"" factor to make it a perfect 10.

Recommendation:
Cyberpunk 2077 is a must-play, especially in its current state. Whether you’re a fan of immersive worlds, gripping narratives, or deep RPG systems, it delivers on almost every front. The Phantom Liberty DLC is the cherry on top of an already incredible experience. It’s not just a game—it’s a world you’ll want to lose yourself in.",1734638463,1734638463,True,394,9,0.9232937097549438,10,False,False,False,False,1091500,20250114_132033,positive,100

The story arcs are nothing short of mind-blowing, weaving together themes of identity, corruption, and the ceaseless march of technology with a finesse rarely seen in video games. With the expansion, players are treated to not just one, but two of the most intricate and emotionally charged narratives ever crafted, each one pushing the boundaries of what video game storytelling can achieve.

-(2.1 version/never playd on release or befor that)-

+ the world the feeling, the huge buildings or when you walk through the streets at night with all the illuminated signs, preferably with rain and ray trace/path trace really goose bumps in some places
+ the story is stronger than i've ever experienced in almost any other game, every side mission is a spectacle that you won't soon forget or that even makes you think(very emotional at some points which literally sucks you in). 
 But that was clear we have the witcher 3 developers here :)
+ the combat system is very complex when combined with mods for the body and weapon skill system and then using melee weapons and then melee skills on top of that.
+ various cars, some of which are very well detailed, and some cool weapons.


- little to do or few minigames outside of the *quests* i would like to see more in cyberpunk 2

From the moment I stepped into Night City, I was completely immersed in its breathtaking atmosphere, compelling characters, and rich narrative. Every moment felt like it mattered, every choice had weight, and the sheer depth of the world kept me coming back for more.

The story is gripping and full of heart, touching on themes of identity, humanity, and freedom in a world dominated by greed and technology. I found myself laughing, crying, and even just sitting still in awe during certain moments. The performances, especially by Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand, are unforgettable.

The gameplay itself is polished and diverse, offering so many ways to approach every situation, and the attention to detail in every corner of the city is stunning. The developers have clearly poured their hearts into this game, and the post-launch updates and the Phantom Liberty expansion have elevated it even further.

I genuinely cannot wait for future content and games set in this universe.

I started playing it a few days ago, and I can't stop. I’ve been a gamer since 1995, and I’ve played every RPG you can possibly imagine since the late 90s. Night City truly feels alive, with so much attention to detail — the immersion, animations, art design, and visuals are beyond breathtaking. I’m mind blown. It’s a haven for both eyes and ears. When I look at NPCs, what they do, their different outfits, fashions, cyber implants, actions, random events, and interior locations—wow, any game I play after Cyberpunk feels outdated, bland, and uninteresting. Cyberpunk is a game ahead of its time.
The weapon handling, choices, and driving mechanics are perfect. I thought voice acting and characters were pinnacle in Baldurs gate III, but I was so wrong, and I am happy I was wrong indeed. For the first time in my life, I’m not skipping even the smallest conversation and just walking around because the city is so dense and packed with so many things. I simply don’t want to fast travel. I’ll be honest: I’m scared, shocked, and amazed by how insanely well-done Cyberpunk is, scared yes and very rarely I’m scared when playing a game. The bizarre, twisted future of cyberware, implants, and characters feels so incredibly real. I can’t believe it. The fact you can watch TV, go on net, purchase, craft, modify use braindance and all these little things as well adds further to quality ,complexity and immersion. I must praise sense of humor too. Anything I can think off is superb.
I didn’t have high expectations for it, but this is unbelievable. I’m so passionate about gaming. Every few steps, I just stop and zoom in on the details, trying to take it all in. How did they do this? How is it even possible? For the first time in my life, I find myself lost in such a complex world. Everything in this game has been crafted masterfully, and to make it even better, the combat is so versatile with so many choices. I’m totally overwhelmed. This game is striking me on so many levels. I feel so tiny and insignificant, especially in the crowd of NPCs, and when walking and looking up at massive structures and tall skyscrapers. The character design is, without a doubt, the best I’ve ever seen as well. Dear God, I don’t know how to explain it—maybe some things can only be felt. Cyberpunk is infinite joy and fun for me.
Massive thanks to the developers. When you have a team of dedicated, talented geniuses, magic happens. Also, I want to say that the prediction of the future is very accurate.
Thank you all for reading and stay safe.

And at this point, it was a total immersion in it's cyberworld, first run through the story until reach point of no return, then completed every gig, every NCPD, spend much time with Johnny, Panam, Judy etc. Couldn't believe that it's suddenly ended when completed everything, but this game was pure satisfaction <3

Year ago with v2.0 update and when I pre ordered Phantom Liberty DLC, it was a reason to dive back again with new story and characters which got even more memorable for me than original base game

Two years has gone since I tried it first time.. This game is like a drug, still satisfying to drive around Night City, still making calls to V's friends, still having feeling is like some unfinished business left here. So many unforgettable memories <3

10/10 Outstanding visuals, great story, huge open world, requieres much time and best action role-playing game of last years <3

A solid and fun RPG today, but I think as time progresses, I think it will be eventually remembered as a beautiful and poignant story and piece of art, like how we view a classic work of literature today, like a Joseph Conrad novel or For Whom The Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway (both authors works are referenced which the writers make clear nods to). I'm so happy I played it and avoided all spoilers. Absorb the story and world as you would a good book or TV series.

The best way to describe the relationship of the main game and the DLC's attributes is using a real world analogy: If the main game (NC) is Hong Kong, then Phantom Liberty (Dogtown) is the Kowloon Walled City. If you think you knew Hong Kong, wait until you learn how insane the Kowloon Walled City was. Apart from the main themes of the Cyberpunk RPG like capitalism gone amok, I liked how the game raises a point how our mortality forces us to question our life choices and the meaning of life. And how time waits for no one.

What really shocked me was how well written and how fun Phantom Liberty DLC was, and how it even surpassed the main story line in story quality, characters and world-building at times.

Regarding lifepaths, personally I think corpo V is the best V since it narratively ties in very well with Arasaka and the price of being a corporate wage slave and the corpo opening scene is my personal favourite of all three, and it even gives the opportunity to show how bloodthirsty the world is and allow V's voice actor to show both strength and vulnerability in a single scene. Corpo V also has some great lines I love. But streetkid and nomad lifepaths also ties in very nicely with achieving your best, and the finding your family in life respectively. Each lifepath also gets 1 unique mission. But ultimately the lifepaths is mostly for flavour and does not affect V's main story in significant ways.

This game affected me quite personally. Some parts I even cried, or even felt that visceral rage at the injustice or powerlessness of some characters, which no other game I played has ever done before. Wonderful voice acting, character design, character animation, fun combat, music, world building. The last time I felt the same way was The Last Of Us released almost a decade ago, and that really got me to seeing video games seriously as a new emerging medium for good stories. And good stories do not necessarily must have happy endings, but good ones meant to provoke thought and feelings, and the writers understood that incredibly well.

I played Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, The Longest Journey, Dreamfall and somehow I feel that they taken the best parts of those games which are flawed in their own ways (some more than others) and put it into Cyberpunk 2077 and the DLC. Really helps that you get to pilot a robot in a point and click adventure style reminiscent of the Longest Journey. I was impressed that the DLC has that Cynosure horror level which also surprised me, a nod to their ability to integrate the psychological horror of Alien Isolation. Perhaps I'll go so far as to say it surpasses the quality and dread you will feel from the ""Ocean House Hotel"" level within Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines. Not to mention Judy's cabin mission and underwater level is unforgettable.

The music in this game is fantastic. Even the character creation menu has its own theme song, and that is one of my favourite pieces. There is even a Chopin piece played by Arasaka's sister, a complete break from the usual electronic or rock music played in the BGM and in world music. That should tell you how awesome the music is. You even get to hear some of Silverhand's band Samurai's rock music pieces. There is a whole station playing songs from Nina Kraviz as you drive through Night City. She even appears as a minor ripperdoc character, which is ironic because she is a trained dentist while V makes an offhand remark to Viktor that they feel like being at a dentist's.

This game had characters that talked like human beings, have their own fears and desires which drive their characters which drive the story. Cherami Leigh has delivered one of the best performances in this game as V, and she has acting range, from joy to anger to fear and despair, you'll feel every moment of it. It certainly helps that Keanu Reeves plays Johnny Silverhand and V's wingman, and is with you almost throughout the entire story, and it would be a completely different game without him throwing his opinions, grows as a character and has his plot brings in the same existential questions about the nature of consciousness as Soma did. I expected Idris Elba to become Stringer Bell from the Wire, but what I saw was a restrained performance of a conflicted and world weary government agent, but in a way that is realistic and still ultimately human. Carla Tassara as Judy really performed and gave one of the most heartbreaking and real performances I felt in a video game ever in one of the scenes, felt too close to home at one point that I had to stop and take a breather. Erica Lindbeck as Misty in both the main game and DLC as V's mother figure had her moments as well, especially in the storage room outside the El Coyote Cojo Bar (another extremely real scene) and also at the ending of the DLC on the staircase. Michael Gregory as Johnny Mnemonic's Spider inspired Viktor Vektor delivers some great scenes as V's father figure in the main game and DLC. The scene where Arasaka Sr and Jr are fighting in Japanese is on another level, like you are watching a forbidden family drama unfold in a foreign language. There are many more voice actors that bring in their best in this, so it is best you experience their performances yourself.

They got into some deserved criticism over game breaking bugs or over-promising in their marketing. But at this point, I think it just became irrelevant in hindsight with the eventual fixes and expectations becoming re-balanced after COVID. Also helped that the Cyberpunk anime on Netflix and DLC attracted new players who were previously uninterested in the game, and see the game for what it is: a masterpiece that needed more time for polish, minor features and fixes. They did not compromise on the story and characters and acting and world building, and that everything technical can always be patched in the end.

It is a shame that the REDengine it runs on will no longer be used in the next Cyberpunk and choosing Unreal instead: this game alone proves it can be used for horror, RPGs (Vampire the Masquerade cough cough with safe areas), racing etc.

I don't know how the team in CD Projekt Red pulled this off, but thank you for making a piece of art that will surely be remembered fondly for generations.

This review is borderline rambling because I'm speaking from the heart for the most part. It's better you experience it first hand yourself instead of watching someone else play it over YouTube because there is much more depth and beauty in this game that should be experienced first hand. If you're still skeptical, I can only quote Silverhand in Keanu Reeves's best scene in the game as he delivers his monologue (or manifesto? hehe), followed by his best line in the game: ""You still don't see it. But you will one day."" Every time I think about the ending of the DLC, see my world I live in and read the papers, sometimes that quote pops up now in my head reminding me how Silverhand is ultimately right in the end.",1722182621,1722228929,True,319,19,0.905875027179718,0,True,False,False,False,1091500,20250114_132033,positive,100

I have to be honest, I would never have thought CD Projekt RED would release such a killer title. The large number of mods will make the game legendary for a long time to come, similar to GTA5.

Anyone who has played Deux Ex will love it. The world literally swallows you up and you just want to do that one quest or knock down the evil gang members on the street. Over time you notice how you get stronger and specialization gradually pays off more and more through super-powerful cyberware. The story is of course very well done and different possible answers produce different results, so there are multiple outcomes, violence is not always the solution. The graphics are of course an insanely massive smash hit, the different weather effects combined with the immersive world are a real feast for the eyes. Good gaming hardware is of course required.

In terms of gameplay, the open world feels like GTA5, the stealth factor like Hitman, the cyberware augmentations are very reminiscent of the game Restricted Area (2004), which you should also try out, it's really good. The perks and the general world setting are like Deux Ex Human Revolution.

Looting fun is of course not neglected either, but some enemies cannot be looted, no matter what angle you are standing at, the game crashed once, but that was it. It has been heavily optimized and is no longer as buggy as it was at release.

All in all, a very good game that I can only recommend. The game will give me many more hours of entertainment, because there is a lot to do and discover.

It was poorly optimized, the gameplay wasn't as fluid and it simply landed up not feeling as good as the sum of all its parts.

Fast forward to today, and I can gladly (and proudly) say that CD Projekt Red listened to feedback. They went back and poured their heart into this game, and made it good. They took away a lot of the clunky feelings to the game and made it into a fun smash em rpg. I found myself very enthralled with the world, connected to the characters, and absolutely loved the absolute attention to detail they put into both the game and the subsequent anime that followed. They literally have locations you see in the anime, in the game. (Sidenote: if you like the game the anime is a must.)

This is one of the few games that pushes my rig to it's limits. So make sure you have a good pc to get the best experience from it. I have an RTX3090 and get around 60 fps with most details turned on. Which is playable but does show how this game will take a relatively newer gpu to really get the perfomance you need to play optimally. It is beautiful scenery when you can play with it on higher settings, so this is one of those games that I lean towards quality graphics over FPS.

As far as story goes, I love that you can start off with a little variation and really build up your characters background a little. I haven't beaten the entire game yet, but know that it has not disappointed in any way on this front. Even the side quests are fun and feel impactful. Its not just the same quests over and over, and there is a lot of variety here.

This game is not just a game to me. The world feels alive and so does every character in the story and side stories. Truly alive and fantastic. I've played countless games in my life but this experience changed my life. I know it's just a stupid video game how can it be so amazing?! Yeah I have no idea. I can't put it into words but this is such an immersive and mature game. It is funny and emotional and real, raw and deep. I love being in the world of this game. I love replaying this game which I never do usually. This game makes me feel things and that is quite an accomplishment trust me :). Every inch of this game and its world is interesting to me and playing through the story doesn't feel like you're doing missions like in most games but it feels like a natural progression and unfolding of a complex and unprecedentely deep narrative. There is also such an incredible feeling of evolution in the story, once you think you know what the stakes and direction are going to be the game throws something completely unexpected at you which changes your adventure and investment in this new adventure.

The cast is also amazing for this game, giving the characters life and memorable moments. Combat mechanics are great, and being able to mod yourself with cyber-ware is one of the coolest experiences I've seen in a game. This game is more than just a visual marvel-it's a storytelling powerhouse and a showcase of how thoughtful design can immerse players completely into a world. Simply put, it's a must-play, especially for those who appreciate deep narratives and richly designed worlds.

I've played the game twice once at launch and I just wrapped up the second playthrough, both were 100% completion with all the endings.

At launch the game was a mess, but I lucked out with a good pc so was able to enjoy it for what it was with the believe of what could be. As there was a true once in a life experience hiding behind all the T poses and car crashes. Back then I already loved the game and saw it as one of my favorites ever but it was nothing to recommend at the time due to its rough shape (or shape at all if you were trying to play on last gen consoles). I can now wholeheartedly recommend this game. The characters, the story paths, the city, the fun builds it all just checks out and it all comes together as one of the most immersive experiences I've ever had. Just sitting down and looking at the city while listening to some music in game can just be so calming after a heartbreaking experience.

Phantom Liberty put things in a cinematic overdrive and lead to some choices where I still don't know what the right choice would have been. Normally that is something I'd heavily dislike but given how there are no real winners in Night City I'd say it fits very well and just gives me more time to think about it all.

Conclusion would be a very strong recommendation for a game that had an abysmal launch, but got fixed up to where it should be. The game still has bugs but none are game breaking from my experience and even though I'm glad they fixed it up, it should have never released in the state that it did. Also to truly understand how beautiful the game is you'd need a fairly beefy pc where the true potential only unlocks with path tracing enabled. Now all there is to do is wait for a follow up, and in a few years time another full completion.

Gameplay is fun, though not very difficult on the default settings. There's a good number of routes you can build your character in. Story is also very good (including DLC), and the multiple endings provide good variety.

My main complaint was that with the size of the world and number of quests, I often would have no idea who or what a given quest was in my journal. You'll often receive quests via a phone call while doing something else, so they're hard to keep track of, even with the information given.

I'm shocked at how incredible this game looks, a whole 4 years after release. 
It's truly mindboggling. It is still easily the most beautiful game, not even counting mods which makes it almost photorealistic. 
The city is the main character of the game, every little corner is so rich, so detailed, so breathtaking. 
The other thing that is so well crafted are the side characters. 
Particularly Panam. 

CD PROJEKT is an expert at crafting female characters, and the romances specifically. 
I fell in love twice, first with Shani from Witcher 3, and now with Panam. 
I would genuinely get excited to see her and talk to her. The writing is great in this case. 

BUT.

The game overall, that is the gameplay, shows its age. 
It gets repetitive, with a ton of side missions that don't bring anything to the table besides being fillers. 
The map is very obsolete, a gazillion icons that, granted, you can filter out, but when you're into the game you worry about missing something so you keep them on. Except there is rarely something special about them. 
Initially I was doing them all but half way through I just got bored to be honest. 

I fully expect Witcher 4 to evolve from this system, particularly the handholding part which shows you where everything is with yellow dots and where you have to go. There is beauty in mystery and exploration, something that you can experience in FromSoft games and Wukong. Cyberpunk just uses the old Ubisoft busy-work mission structure that I, and I'm sure many, are tired of. 

On a personal note I was also turned off by the Male V protagonist, namely the voice actor. He just does a bad job, he doesn't sound natural like a normal human, his acting and voice are over the top broey, like Kyle Crane. 
To be honest, I also don't like Geralt's voice acting, although in this case you could say his voice has some sort of brand particularity, whereas V is just a parody of a normal person. 

Finally, the bugs. After all these updates, there are still a TON of bugs. Granted I don't know how it was initially, I imagine it must have been a lot worse and progress was made. But you should know that there are game breaking bugs still present, and many of them. 

A lot of important side missions will stop updating. You would expect a phone call that never comes no matter how much you progress and what you do, this goes for many missions. And those are side character missions. You can look this up, there are all kinds of work-arounds for it to this day that don't always work. 
And the main mission, the best ending, was broken for me. I restarted it twice and both times at some point the game bugs out, certain robot enemies become invulnerable, even at 0HP and the story cannot progress unless you kill them. 

So I wasn't able to even see my favorite ending.

Plus one DLC, some bugfixes and a short list of goodies. It was an excellent game at launch too, people just wanted to be a part of the hate train back then. After the successful anime those who haven't played it actually tried it, and now we ended up with this ""they fixed the game"" fiction to rationalize past overreactions.

(also CDPR hyped up the game to a point where no game can deliver, no matter how good it is. Never let marketing department this much loose.) 

This game not being Overwhelmingly Positive will forever bother me. As of 2024, this is still one of the all-time best experiences ever made. Even four years after release, it's in its own category. Night City is the perfect setting to tell this fantastic story, there is something to see at every turn, so many memorable characters, meaningful choices, all told in a first-person, very immersive way. Music is great, combat is great, and very diverse in how you can approach it. Of course the graphics and the artwork is on its own class, there isn't another game in this genre that looks better than this.

I just got all trophies in this masterpiece.

I know, I know, first impressions are what leave a mark, and this game had its image tarnished right after launch with bugs that made it unplayable. However, I must base this analysis on my experience, which was peaceful and smooth—no bug prevented me from enjoying the game (sometimes, quite the opposite; seeing my car fly into space was hilarious!).

The story of this game is phenomenal—dense and full of nuances. Not just the main story, but also the magnificent side plots that add even more depth and personality to the world. Night City is a living organism; there’s always something happening, whether it's an operation from one of the game’s “factions,” which are amazing, by the way. The mysticism they bring further enriches the creation of the cyberpunk atmosphere.

Before I started playing, I was already comparing it to The Witcher 3, even unintentionally. I believed the enemies wouldn’t have much variety and would all be similar to the soldiers from The Witcher. However, I was pleasantly surprised—the diversity of enemies in this game is quite impressive. How you deal with them is up to you. Diving deeper into this aspect, I’d say there are two gameplay styles you can adopt: stealthy or all-out combat. It may sound simple, but the game presents various tools and mechanics that assist you in different ways. I genuinely enjoyed the gameplay and how it works, and I believe that even if you’re not a fan of first-person games, you should give it a chance.

The characters are fantastic! Each one has their universe and perspective. The way V interacts with them is masterfully done. I don’t think I’ll ever forget this work’s storyline, mainly because of its characters. They were developed with such passion and care that you start getting attached to them. Johnny Silverhand will stay in my head just like he does in V’s. Panam and Judy will remain in my heart. The questline involving Evelyn is soul-crushing, and I believe it has the same impact as the Bloody Baron’s story in The Witcher 3—it’s etched into my memory.

Now, speaking about the DLC, Phantom Liberty: my friends, what a masterpiece!! Also comparing it to The Witcher 3 – Blood and Wine, I suspected it couldn’t be as well-constructed and innovative. I thought it would be more like the other DLC, Hearts of Stone, but how wrong I was, haha. Dogtown is as magnificent as Toussaint. It’s practically a whole new universe, brimming with nuances and fresh personality. Regarding the storyline—oh, what a story! It could easily be considered a completely new game. It’s a narrative that draws you into the characters’ dilemmas and immerses you in their backstories. So Mi will always have a place in my heart. Reed is a layered character—hard to understand at first, but over time, you feel like you can treat him as a brother by the end. The DLC, in addition to presenting us with a fantastic story, further enriches the main one we have in Night City.

I consider Cyberpunk 2077 another masterpiece by CD Projekt Red. The developer has definitely redeemed itself after the shameful launch.

In its most profound depths, this experience incites one to interrogate the very nature of autonomy in a reality where infinite potential is inextricably entwined with invisible confines.

CD Projekt Red is one of these few studios that would take the time to polish their craft in the most beautiful way ever; before jumping to their next project.
We saw this happen with Witcher 3, I actually was one of the few who didn't play that game until 2-3 years have passed and when I did I quickly became a huge fan of it.
When I saw Cyberpunk back in 2020 and the state it was in, I really was hopeful that this studio will one day deliver as they did with The Witcher 3, so I bought the game at that time, and didn't play much of it and I waited.. and waited
And Just December of last year (2023) I started playing it, and ohh boy did they deliver in a big way; as I do to this day keep playing it, hoping to get all the achievements soon (got 2 to go :D)

I am a day one player, I was there during the disastrous launch of this game. I can say without hesitation that my first experience was a roller-coaster of bugs, crashes, and frustration, especially playing on a PS4! It was a mess. However, there was something about this game that kept me hooked.

Despite the flaws, this game managed to captivate me in a way few games ever have. It became the first game I ever platinumed, something  that I never achieved with other games, and I beat the game not once, but twice! I am a sucker for a good narrative, and Cyberpunk 2077 kept me playing because of its storytelling and characters and its fascinating world.

Fast forward to 2024, I am revisiting the game again (for the DLC), starting my third playthrough, this time on PC. With the recent updates, the transformation is remarkable. The world feels more alive, the improvements evident in every corner. Quality of life updates have polished the experience, making it smoother and more enjoyable than ever.

To those still on the fence about diving into Cyberpunk 2077, now is the time. The game has evolved from its troubled beginnings into something truly special.

The stories and quests are interesting and the amount of customization options and stuff you can do in the game, is basically up to your desire and there's generally no limits. To me cyberpunk 2077 is like GTA but set in a futuristic city/world. Your able to do jobs to make money, go to clubs and hang out, and customize your character however you want. There's just a ton of stuff available to do!

What finally sold me on picking up Cyberpunk is finding out about the many mods from cars, to character customization options that are available to download by excellent and talented mod creators. I am having a lot of fun going around and doing jobs, interacting with people in the world and sometimes battling with the police and enemies, and also driving around my car collection.

I had to reinstall this game to remind myself that not everyone has sold their soul to pander to fringe lunatics.

Here we have adult themes, characters that are more than their gender, real, well developed, fleshed out entities that you can love, hate, want to help, want to hurt, want to stop, want to remove from the universe. Where the story is more important than the fear of upsetting some group of professionally offended safe space snowflakes.

We have everything in this game, from the depths of depravity to the ultra realistic ""normal"" people trying to live their lives as best as they can, sometimes doing ""good"" sometimes doing ""bad"" who gets to decide what is good or bad though? that is entirely subjective on where you stand, just like in the real world. 

And it is that complexity that sucks you in and enables CP2077 to have a living breathing world, and not some one dimensional snoozefest.

This game and its amazing DLC Phantom Liberty are beacons of what is possible in the current sea of mediocrity, a lighthouse, lighting the way for any adult out there who wants to escape from the stress and absurdity of gender politics in the real world and not have it take over their hobby space.

The story is a little bit too rushed (I understand that it is set up in a way that justifies it), especially when you consider how much stuff there is aside from the main story and side-missions. In my opinion, while there's a lot of world building being done via main characters in gigs, there's a distinct lack of character building surrounding some secondary characters (yes, Panam, Judy, Kerry and the likes have pretty fleshed out glimpses into their lives at crucial moments). Take Alt, for example, she is basically the key actor in the whole Soulkiller saga, yet all we get is a story mission and that's it. Misty, while not being directly involved, is our friend and not giving her at least one side-mission where we do, Idk, something mundane, like visiting the columbarium is kinda sad. 

Anyway, gameplay-wise Cyberpunk 2077 is pretty solid. All key systems have been streamlined since the 2.0 update, so you can focus more on exploring the world rather than figuring out how to mod your pants.

It will be completely spoiler free. Hope you enjoy. 

[LORE]  
First up let's talk about the story and the lore. I never expected it to have such a huge world and plot, it's amazing, the details and everything. it seems like it's taken from a novel series, it's THAT deep and well written. You as the main character V, make decisions and those decisions are important, they matter and will determine how the story goes on. you can interact with characters and the world your own way by choosing voice lines and deciding different stuff. All this not only determine your fate, but also the characters' fates, and your relationships with them, and of course the overall story and its progress. 
So basically, Cyberpunk 2077 totally immerses you in its lore by giving you options like these and some very difficult decisions you'll have to make throughout the game. However, you'll actually completely get what I said up here IF you play the side quests and try to complete at least some of them. This is one of those games you really shouldn't rush. the side quests are totally worth it. worth everything. 
There are multiple side quests that some go very deep and are attached to important characters, so those side quests also determine your relations with those certain important characters, such as Judy, River and Panam. 

[GAMEPLAY]
 The game is in first person, but you can change it to third person when driving. There are all kinds of weapons that you can modify too. You can complete missions in any way you want really. You can be stealth or go ham and get that LMG out and slaughter em all, and don't worry it doesn't necessarily affect your ending, however you must be careful what you do in certain missions and actually listen to characters' requests and guides, otherwise if you for example kill a certain npc in a certain Judy side quest, you can no longer have any side quest with Judy, but other than that in the open world and in most story or even side missions, killing enemies, being stealthy, leaving them alive or anything else doesn't really matter that much. see what suits your style.
You can drive cars and bikes and each are very different from each other in terms of how you drive them and the places you can go with them. you'll really sense that once you try some different cars. 
You can customize your character completely, even after creating it at the beginning of the game. clothes, appearance, everything pretty much. 

[GRAPHICS AND OPTIMIZATION]
The graphics are what you would expect, amazing, they've done a very good job with detailing the city, the graphics, textures and models. The options really let you change a lot in the video and graphics section based on your needs and desires for better image or better performance. Don't get too lost in it in the beginning though. You'll figure out what settings best suit you and your computer specs after playing the game a little why and testing things. 
I for example, have an RTX 2060, AMD Ryzen 5 3600, with 16 GB of 3200mhz ram, and I play on a HDD, on a 1080p 60hz monitor. I chose the High preset settings, but improved some other settings for better image, and I get like 60+ stable FPS. I didn't choose this right in the beginning, I chose it after like 5 hours into the game and testing different settings throughout the game. My game had lags at first, it eventually got fixed after some changes in the settings. 
Overall, the graphics and optimization of the game is pretty good.

[LENGTH]
The game's quite long. I played pretty much all the important side quests with important characters alongside the main quests, and it all took me about 45 hours. I'd say it could take you somewhere between 20 - 80 hours depending on how many side quests you finish and how much you explore. I didn't finish some side quests because they didn't involve any important characters and didn't contribute to the story much, but played everything else so clean and completely. 

[AUDIO AND SOUNDTRACK]
Masterpiece, unique, literally can't say enough about how good the audio and soundtrack of the game is and how much it adds to the game and experience. 
NOTHING wrong with any of it, absolutely perfect. perfect. Just for the record, I've got all the soundtrack on my phone and listen to them, and right now as I'm writing this, I'm listening to it on Steam thanks to them giving it for free after purchasing the game. 

[EDDIES]
Got it with a very good 50% discount, but it's definitely worth the base price, completely. 

[BUGS}
The game still has so many bugs and they can get annoying. They were many in the first few hours of the game but gradually got better. One other thing is that usually when I played more than 4 hours without a break, I would see some very random bugs and issues that could get so annoying, but I guess it makes sense kinda. The game is huge, gotta give it a break. 
Besides that, I didn't really notice any real bad bugs or issues in the game or the settings. This game is polished. 

[RATNG]
2077/10 Can't go wrong, one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. 

[TIPS]
If you've read everything so far, I really appreciate your time and concern, so here's some tips I understood during the game that will free you of any need to external guides, and hopefully help you have an experience as great as mine. 

1. Save your game once in a while, sure the game has auto save but to really get the most of the game and missions and the lore, sometime you'll find yourself in need to replay a certain part of the game. try to save your game whenever you feel like something important is gonna happen or you're gonna take an important decision. you'll never know, you might need it. it will save your time. 

2. Play the side quests, trust me. even if you have to force yourself to do it, just give em a try at least, and I'm talking about the important side quests that the main characters give you. Judy, Panam, River, Claire, Delamain, Kerry, Paralezes, these are the characters you really shouldn't ignore. If you do, I can assure you you'll miss out on half of the game, in terms of everything. 

3. Be good with Johnny and he can be the most trustworthy character in the game, for the most part. sometimes when you find yourself struggling to make an important decision, Johnny is always there and talks to you. listen to him, he's not all that heartless terrorist you might think. Just don't ignore him, hear him out, sure he can sometimes say dumb things that just don't make sense to do considering the fact that you're not him, and certainly don't blindly go with him if you're completely sure about what you wanna do and what you believe is right, but I'm talking about the moments that not even you know what to do, when you're in complete confusion, lost. Listen to him, you usually won't regret it. This can be true about some other characters and situations too. Overall, don't be that lone wolf, listen to your allies. they might be right and helpful.

After an extremely backlash filled release in late 2020, CDPR has done their best to convert the entire game to what players were expecting to it be released as. In summary, they have done that!

Over the years, CDPR have focused immensely on bug and glitch fixes that moved it from a broken buggy mess to something distinctly playable, with that wonderful open world experience we all wanted to immerse ourselves in. 

I’m very impressed with what they’ve managed to achieve with this revision to the game and I believe it is finally living up to its full potential. With the DLC released, this brought fresh eyes to the game and allowed players of old to come back and experience a new play through of the game without those game breaking bugs they were so used to seeing previously.
I believe the game is just a lot more FUN to play. It was great because of its storytelling and design before but now it’s just better in every possible way.

Considered one of the biggest changes, is the fact that you can now engage in vehicle combat with things like car chases, shooting out tires, and shooting at each other. It’s something that was strongly needed in the game and makes the massive number of vehicles actually useful now. The various criminals and opponents in Night City are no longer nearly as limited as they used to be. This again, helps with the challenge and makes encounters things that players are going to want to take slowly. 

You can double-jump, slow time, use quick hacks and use all manner of meaningful abilities to cut your enemies into literal strands of ribbons. Fast travel points are everywhere in the large map, and dialogue can be skipped with the press of a button that visually fast-forwards time. The game has NPCs that are relatable and universally well-written, cut scenes that are engaging, and a host of great soundtrack options to accompany your playthrough. Combat is excellent and offers a wide choices of ways to take down your enemies in Night City, so you can always find a suitable way that you prefer to play.

As far as 2024 goes, having completed the main game and the DLC, Cyberpunk is a game I would replay in a heartbeat! Highly recommended to anyone who's looking to lose a bunch of hours in an immersive open world RPG.

Really, really good game. The launch was rocky as we all know but it's solid. It's also very beautiful, fun as heck and has an expansion pass that very much adds a lot to the game for a price that isn't ridiculous.

It's obviously not perfect but it's just a hell of a good game and you gotta respect developers when they pull a broken game out from the dirt even after everyone has bought into it from the hype.

Cyberpunk 2077 was the best story rich game I played this year and I have to say how I'm still impressed by the dialogue lines, which by the way, I haven't skipped any.
Character development is 10/10. The engagement is 10/10. The immersion is 10/10. How do you feel after finishing the game is 10000000/10

Night City is by far the most complexed city I have ever had the pleasure to explore. By the time I had my fill exploring the city, I came to a conclusion that I have never played a game that hasn't recycled anything but this one. Everything is unique, each part of the city. There's no Ctrl C Ctrl V anywhere, with the exception of some NPCs and cars, but that's it.

The gameplay is really good, although I found stealth approach not very practical, since the hitboxes are still an issue, that also applies for looting.
I found some bugs here and there, still not a perfect game, but far from a Ubisoft/Bethesda/EA experience where you need to download mods to make their games properly work.

This is the first game that really makes you choose dialogue options based on what you (PLAYER) believe, your values and principles stays on the line. It doesn't feel like a Bethesda generic driven conclusions.
This is as far as we can get of a GTA 6 first person with real tities and katana.

The soundtracks? beautifully presented with the correct timing for each occasion. The SAMURAI songs drove me crazy, Keanu Reeves and Cherami leigh voices are the just best.

Back in the day when I pre ordered this game I had the utmost disappointing experience of my life in a video game. Now, 4 years later I can finally put that memory to rest, knowing that what I have now won't fade away.

When i entered the night city at first , it mesmerized me with it's design and neon lights , its so good that you can just take some screenshots and make it as your wallpaper , and i love the fact that different sides of the city represents of its own quality of life within .

Besides from city , main characters in this game is just awesome , they feel so realistic with their writing , design, and this one is my favorite ; the voice acting , its really top tier. 
As for the main story ; i wouldn't give an oscar but it was good enoıugh. and for the side missions i respect that they put something meaningfull to them , instead of just killing some random bad guy , they are giving you the reasons and desicion to make for it. I also want to mention that some themes and musics are just to good.
A little note that After the cyberpunk edgerunners anime which is really good in my opinion , In-game references against anime is cherry on top .

Even the people who dont play cp77 would know that there are 3 paths you can choose at the begining of the game, they have some minor impacts in the story such as the first thirty minutes of the begining and adding some path related dialog options to feel like your following or used to follow that path you choosed 
Some players might say its changing nothing and has nothing to do in games progress and i dont agree with that much 
because i think its all about adding some persona to your playthrough rather then chaning the whole story arc just beacuse you were a corpo guy or used to hang out with nomads, it doesnt make sense.

For the gameplay part its really enjoyable and has a good amount of variety to make your own build an have fun with it
The combat system is to Satisfying that its making you wanna try different builds to get into combat with it 
Also, as a car maniac i can say that there are some good looking ones and overall driving feels very nice.
Not to mention that replayability is higher if you want to see different conclusions and differents way to get that conclusions. 

As for the cons ; i would say that the main story is a bit short if you just rush through it, i havent encontered a lot of bugs like has to be around 5-10 within three hundered hours but man , its crashing a lot , almost once or twice in a day, dont know if its because i have tons of mods or not but it is what it is. 
it has four different difficulty options and i really dont like the way they work, if you increase your diff, your character takes more damage, deals less and complete opposite for the enemy, so it has nothing unique but you could say that this is not a game stands out with difficulties. other then some personal preferences i dont think cp77 has major cons anymore . 

Lastly i think cyberpunk 77 is a prime open-world, action-adventure RPG game to give it a try at least once.

it was quite the experience. from the moment I stepped into night city, i was blown away by the sheer scale and detail of the world. the neon lights, towering skyscrapers, and gritty streets all contribute to an atmosphere that’s both immersive and hauntingly beautiful. how each district in night city has its own story and personality. the story itself is a rollercoaster, filled with twists, memorable characters, and moral dilemmas that made me question my choices. I especially enjoyed the depth of customization for my character, allowing me to truly make V my own. the game didn’t just provide an escape for me; as i navigated V’s journey, fighting to survive against all odds, I found myself drawing strength from the character’s relentless determination. The story’s themes of identity, survival, and defiance against a world set on breaking you i resonated deeply with,it really felt like I was carving my own path in this messed-up world.
the combat is intense and offers a variety of playstyles, whether you prefer going in guns blazing or taking a more stealthy, hacker approach. cyberpunk 2077 delivers a unique and engaging experience that’s well worth diving into, especially for fans of the cyberpunk genre. It’s a game that challenges you to think, adapt, and immerse yourself in a world that’s as beautiful as it is dangerous. despite its rocky launch, it has evolved into a must-play title. also JOHNNY reeeeeee i love im so much

Despite the delay, I can confidently say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. Night City feels massive and alive, almost like a character itself, full of depth and detail as any of the well-developed characters in the game.

Though it may look like Grand Theft Auto, this game is truly an RPG at heart. The numerous skill checks can significantly impact your experience. You can fail missions, lose the trust of your contacts, and even see some characters leave your life forever.

The characters are unforgettable, with many memorable moments from start to finish. Even the minor characters have full voice acting and detailed personalities with backstories. The level of detail in every aspect of this game is astonishing, especially when compared to other games released around the same time. It's clear that CDPR was on another level when they created Cyberpunk 2077. They knew what they wanted to make, and despite taking twice as long as expected, the final result is incredible.

There are many ways to build your character, and you won't be good at everything, which I love. Your choices carry weight, and if something doesn't go your way, well, that's life. I embrace my bad choices too.

I cannot recommend this game enough. If you decide to pick it up, I highly recommend installing Phantom Liberty from the start. Unlike typical DLC, which often feels like a separate mission, Phantom Liberty is seamlessly integrated into the main storyline around the mid-point of the game. It fits perfectly and even provides extra dialogue options in the main story if completed beforehand.

The care and thought put into this game are truly impressive, making Cyberpunk 2077 a prime example of what next-gen gaming should aspire to.

The graphics are stunning, with a level of detail that brings Night City to life. With Phantom Liberty, the performance has been smooth, and I've encountered very few bugs. The world is visually captivating, with incredible lighting and reflections that add to the immersive experience.

The main story is compelling, with twists and turns that keep you engaged. The side quests are equally engaging, often providing deep character insights and additional layers to the story. Every quest feels meaningful and adds value to the overall experience.

The customization options for your character are extensive, from appearance to abilities. The gameplay is diverse, allowing for various playstyles. I went for a stealth SMG/AR build with a high focus on movement abilities and it was lots of fun!

Cyberpunk 2077 is an ambitious game that delivers on many fronts. Despite its rocky launch, the game has evolved into a masterpiece.

Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was this very interesting guy with the nickname Toko, and what many people didn't know, the name came from the character Motoko Kusanagi 
(Ghost In The Shell), which many people also didn't know at the time. The small town I lived in at the time had a basketball court in every direction, so we said either the swampy north court, the bosomy south court or the gallows-filled west court. 
Toko always and only played on the colorful east court, 
because he lived around the corner and only left the area when he had to. 
At that time basketball was a big thing for me and I went to a lot of different places to see who was the best and if I could beat them. But the east court was never really busy so I didn't go there that often, but when I did, Toko was always there. He was very secretive at first and we hardly talked until the moment he did or said something that reminded me of a movie I had seen the night before: Shadowzone. And not only did he know the movie, he also knew what year it was released and the other movies from that distribution company. 
From that day, we got on really well and pretty soon he mentioned the first time that he was playing a pen & paper game called Cyperpunk 2020 with some friends. Eventually I had to move away from that town and I never saw this guy again, but whenever anything cyberpunk related came up, I remembered that time. In 2020, when Cyberpunk 2077 was released, I was giving an online workshop on electronic music production and one of the participants told us how much he was looking forward to this game but never been so disappointed in something. We watched a lot of videos with recorded game scenes that were full of bugs and glitches and it was freakin hilarious. After that we made a small Cyberpunk Remix in 2 parts and I secretly swore to myself, someday I will play this game when it is playable at some point.

The character development in Cyberpunk 2077 is unfortunately not as strong as it could be, and the lifepaths are disappointing variations to an otherwise rather linear story. 

Nevertheless, the world and its writing is absolutely incredible and is undoubtedly the strongest aspect of the game. I strongly recommend this game to RPG fans with a strong desire for satisfying, fast-paced combat. If your main desire is player choice and creating a character that you can self-insert as, cRPGs are better suited to meet your needs. 

Night City is gorgeous and brimming with areas that you can explore. There isn't too much variety in terms of loot outside of weapons and cyberware... If you like cosmetics, there's a ton of loot when it comes to clothing. Other than that, it just boils down to crafting components for weapons and quickhacks.

The story is pretty action-heavy (who would have guessed) and is well built but also a bit basic in my opinion.

In general Cyberpunk 2077 (also including the DLC) is an excellent adrenaline rushed experience with humorous elements bullying late-capitalism-ideologies mixed with an insane creative mix of futurism and the ""real world"".

The Witcher 3 is a fantastic game set in a fascinating universe. It has amazing music and characters that support an interesting story with consequences for your actions. In my opinion the only downside is how repetitive most missions feel (Use witcher senses, track something, repeat) The expansion Blood and Wine improves upon this though.

I wish I could go back and experience it for the first time.

Writing this after just finishing Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut - the game is great: well-written story, enjoyable gameplay, and visually stunning, but it made me realize that in comparison, The Witcher 3 is still on another level—a masterpiece. I've played numerous RPGs, but few come close to The Witcher 3 in terms of the overall experience, including immersion, world-building, role-playing, player choices, blend of fantasy and realism, soundtrack, and replayability. The Next-Gen update has also made the game look absolutely stunning and not at all dated. The world, especially Toussaint, is incredibly beautiful.

The combat may be the weakest part of the game and can feel slightly dated, but it's definitely playable and not as bad as some people say. My favorite aspect is preparing for combat—knowing which potions or signs to use against specific types of enemies and situations.

One aspect that sets The Witcher 3 apart from other games is the developers' attention to detail, which makes the world extremely immersive and story-rich. The variety in the side quests is remarkable in terms of storytelling, often blending elements encountered elsewhere. Many of these quests are even more entertaining than the main storyline. This attention extends to random world encounters; in most other games, it's simply about killing bandits or rescuing someone, but in The Witcher 3, you can become invested in random characters you meet on the road, sympathize with their stories, investigate, and make tough decisions that leave you pondering whether you made the right choice.

I also appreciate that throughout the game—whether in main quests, side quests, or random encounters—you have the freedom to make choices, although sometimes the wording can be misleading in certain quests. Almost every choice has impactful, sometimes far-reaching, and unexpected consequences, which enhances the world's immersion, realism, and complexity. You can play as you like, shaping Geralt as you imagine or want him to be. This freedom is something I enjoy more than RPGs where players have limited decision-making and must follow a predetermined path.

It is definately the best game I've ever played in my life, it's like a work of art that I'm glad I had the chance to experience.
Every place you go feels so alive, the characters are so well written that most of the time I would get completely immersed into the conversations with them.
When you look back at it after doing everything, every single quest, all the expansions, all the places.. You feel something like a good memory from the past, a feeling of nostalgia..
When people say this game is big, it's kinda hard to understand what it means, for some, it's the map, or the number of quests, or even the size of the campaign, but I believe this game is big on what it tried to achieve, on the greatness of the story that it told, the powerful effects of your choices, the felling you have when you discover a new monster and quickly have to adapt to overcome it, the experience you have when picking up a trail, or sailing through the cold oceans of skellige alone..

I'll admit it was a slow burn for the first few hours, and I wasn't exactly captivated initially. I had heard incredible things about this game and I began to wonder what all the hype was about. I'm glad I persisted because the payoff was immeasurable. After getting through the opening missions, the story picks up quickly and I was then sucked into the incredible world created by CD Projekt Red. And what a world it is. The map is absolutely massive, with various different environments to explore. The landscapes are beautiful and appear full of life, from random travellers to nefarious creatures roaming the wild. The sea, likewise, has much variety for those willing to explore the murky depths. The cities and villages feel alive, NPC's actually seem to have some purpose as they go about their tasks, there are shops and taverns everywhere with many accessible indoor areas. There are weather changes and a day/night cycles as well to add even more realism. 

The main story presents us with finding Ciri, and reaching her before the malevolent Wild Hunt. For those that haven't played the first two games, while they loosely continue certain events and character relationships, they aren't really necessary to enjoy the adventure here. I would argue though that while the main story does a good enough job of moving the game along, the shining stars are the side quests. Like most RPG's, side quests are a staple with this genre but in Witcher 3 some of these quests are actually much better overall. These quests are everywhere, even a small village has several be it help tracking down a missing person, hunting down a certain creature terrorising the land, or retrieving certain items for a reward. Geralt after all is a bounty hunter and makes his living through these jobs. Also, while some may disagree, I really enjoyed the Gwent mini-game and this could have easily made its own stand alone game (which it eventually did). 

The game provides a lot of options for character builds, with options to focus on alchemy, signs, combat or a mix of these. The character tree is deep enough but also not so deep as to need a university math degree to understand, which suits me more than fine. The combat system seems fluid and responsive, albeit simple. Sometimes the camera would frustrate me, especially with multiple enemies. 

Finally two expansions were released after the main game. They were offered for free and they may be even better than the base game. Specifically Blood and Wine holds a special place in my heart as the landscapes, characters and overall story is outstanding. I'm amazed that CD Projekt Red would just give these away, yet it displays a certain type of class that just isn't prevalent in the gaming industry anymore. 

Witcher 3 was a game I got sucked into during the heat of the Covid Pandemic, and it created some lasting memories into this brilliant world. I was so entranced with the experience (once I finally got hooked) and offered some much needed escapism during this difficult period (I work as an ER nurse). In fact I actually completed all the Steam achievements, collected all the Gwent cards and completed every side mission. And this was before I became a game completionist.   I doubt I'll ever be able to recreate the gaming experiences I had during this era.

I finished the main story plus the first DLC when I already had around 370 hours played, and the second DLC which was also one of the best DLCs I've ever played was so large that I could say it felt like a completely different game in The Witcher series (a mini-sequel), finishing the whole game (including every contract, side quest, place to explore, etc.) in 430 hours without any NG+ or other replays.

[*]ㅤI started this game as a newbie, I would say, not having played the other two games in the series and having no knowledge of the story from the books or the movie. (For someone who has to choose a game from a series for the first time, they will always pick the most recent one for the graphics and other aspects, right?)
I'd say that someone who has no clue about what The Witcher is about won't understand much at the beginning of the game, as I didn't either, since the events in the game follow and are connected to the events in the previous two games (obviously). Everything starts quite abruptly, and some events are presented somewhat summarily in my opinion. I spent about a quarter of my gameplay time on various external websites, researching and getting an idea of what was going on, what events took place before The Witcher 3, who is fighting whom, who is who, etc., and I realized that the entire story is much broader than I had imagined, which made me adore this game along with the innovative mini-game of Gwent that was introduced in the base game; quite intuitive, easy to learn, and straightforward.

[*]ㅤI have to say honestly that I didn't like the first area at the beginning of the game at all, not in terms of design, but in how the actions unfolded and how the conversations between characters played out, giving me the impression of a gloomy, vague, and boring game that was to follow. Because of this, I was on the verge of giving the game a negative review, but I decided to give it another chance and time to see what it's capable of, as progressing in the game only to later realize that I could have made the biggest mistake of my life, despite everyone saying it is an extraordinary game filled with positive reviews.

[*]ㅤAt first, it was hard to understand and get used to the game's mechanics, but in the end, I managed to get the hang of it. The gameplay is great, but there were some aspects that I didn't really like; for instance the combat, which is kind of clunky and leaves a bit to be desired, but over time, you start to get good at it. Despite this, I should be glad, because I've heard from others that the combat is much worse in The Witcher 1 and 2, as well as the movement. Another aspect that's kind of ridiculous is the very low height from which you can fall and die. I mean, seriously, I fell from about 2m - 2.5m and died having full health; and another aspect that wasn't necessarily unpleasant was the bugs encountered throughout the game, one here, one there, but overall nothing very significant that would make the game unplayable.

[*]ㅤThe story is very complex and well-structured, very well designed areas, astonishing soundtracks that blend perfectly with the in-game atmosphere, there are a lot of characters, and the dialogue between them is very well written, the voice acting is excellent, and maybe that's why I shouldn't even have to say it anymore, as many have said it before me, but it's worth mentioning that [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] is a masterpiece, and it's truly one of the most acclaimed RPGs of all time. There's no doubt that I would fully recommend this game and I definitely intend to play the other two games in the series because this game got my full attention and gave me an excellent introduction to The Witcher universe, even if I started with the end.[/list]

From the moment you start playing, you're sucked into this incredibly detailed world filled with monsters, magic, and political intrigue.

The storyline is just...wow. It's so rich and immersive, with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. And the characters? They feel so real, with their own personalities, motivations, and flaws. You really get invested in their journeys, which makes every decision you make feel weighty and important.

And let's talk about the world itself. It's massive, but it never feels empty or boring. There's always something to do, whether it's hunting down monsters, exploring hidden caves, or just chilling in a tavern playing Gwent. And speaking of Gwent, don't even get me started on how addictive that card game is!

Combat is another highlight. It's challenging, but in a good way. You have to be strategic with your swordplay, magic, and potions to take down tougher enemies, and it feels incredibly satisfying when you pull off a tough fight.

Honestly, I could go on and on about how amazing this game is, but I'll just say this: if you haven't played The Witcher 3 yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up. You won't regret it.

There’s a certain wisdom in Geralt’s solitary wandering—a tacit acknowledgment that sometimes, solitude isn’t loneliness but liberation. In Geralt’s journey, we glimpse Cioran’s musings on the absurdity of existence, where life’s weight becomes bearable because it’s accepted, not resisted. The game doesn’t resolve the chaos of the world, nor does it offer easy answers—it revels in moral ambiguity and existential bleakness, making the escape all the more meaningful. Like Cioran, who saw despair as life’s backdrop, The Witcher 3 crafts an escapism that doesn't seek to deny reality but to confront it with detachment. Here, the solitude of the path sharpens focus, and clarity arises not from solving life's riddles, but from accepting that they never had answers in the first place.

I’d say it’s easily in my top twenty games – no easy feat, since I usually find open-world games repugnant.

In fact, I tried playing it long before I settled in and played it start to finish. I was immediately inundated with a horde of characters who acted as if I should already know who they were. By the time I got to the part where I could freely explore the world, I was already overwhelmed. Letting me loose to explore the land as I pleased only made me feel more anxious. So, I stopped playing then and there.

Something about the experience must have captured my imagination, though. Since I was miffed that I learned little about the characters other than their names and a bit about their relationships with Geralt, I decided that I should be better prepared if I ever tried playing it again. That’s when I vowed that I would read the books before I went back to the game.

Then years went by. (I’ve got tons of practice at saying I’ll do something and then never doing it. It’s something I’m super good at.) I didn’t really think about it again until the first season of the Netflix series was announced. And suddenly, I was determined to read the books and play this game before the show debuted.

What ensued was a months-long quest to read everything from [i]The Last Wish[/i] to [i]Season of Storms[/i]. Between the first few books in the series, I read other, random books to keep from burning myself out. By the end of the series, though, I was reading the books back-to-back. Not because I was running out of time before the show came out… No, the books had me completely captivated.

This was a little strange to me. After reading [i]The Hobbit[/i] and [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i] series a couple of years prior and finding it to be a miserable experience (yes, I hate [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i] books – fight me, Tolkien nerds), I had avoided fantasy books and, more broadly, book series altogether. So, to find myself completely infatuated with this fantasy series I had only heard of through video game news articles and wanting more and more of it left me dumbstruck. From the first two books (that are filled with monsters and action and sex but were still able to contain some depth) to [i]The Lady of the Lake[/i] (whose narrative structure resembles a Russian nesting doll, with each layer showing another step in Ciri’s path to become the most powerful Witcher in history), I was in for the ride completely. I was thrilled, I laughed, and, though it’s been a few years and my memory is hazy, I probably bawled like a little baby in the end.

Anyway, as I mentioned before, after the final book in the series, I wanted more. Luckily, there was [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] waiting for me in my Steam library. And, this time, I was ready.

My god, this game. I can’t describe what it felt like to finally see these characters that I had spent months reading about brought to life to continue their adventures. To say I was moved would undersell the way I felt the first time I hopped onto Roach and galloped through the hills of Velen. This game was completely engrossing for hundreds of hours and it’s something that I’ll never forget.

However, there is something even more important that my experience with [i]The Witcher[/i] has done for me: I’ve discovered a love for fantasy, and I’ve been more open to reading book series. (Serieses? Seri? Whatever.) Since my time spent with Geralt and the rest of the crew, I’ve read both [i]The First Law[/i] series by Joe Abercrombie and [i]The Expanse[/i] by James S. A. Corey – two series I never would have even considered reading if it wasn’t for [i]The Witcher[/i]. Hell, I even got a tattoo of Geralt’s magic signs down my forearm a couple of weeks ago.

As you can probably tell, this game means a great deal to me. I can’t do anything besides recommend it. (And the book series, obviously.)

But I think the most important thing to take a way from this review is this: [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i] fucking sucks, guys. Guys: it’s boring as hell. It’s just [b]sooooo[/b] shitty, guys. [i]The Witcher[/i] makes [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i] its bitch. Do you know what I do when I can’t sleep? I turn on [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i] and I slip into a coma out of pure boredom. If I was trapped on a deserted island with only [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i], I’d let myself get eaten by sharks. [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i] is so dumb, it might as well be yo momma…

...

[i]Edit: I thought I should mention that this is my 100th review on Steam, so I wanted it to be something special. I hope you found it worthwhile.

I've played this game, including the dlcs about six or seven times now and it really is my favorite game of all time. Every time I jump into a new play-through I lose a week of my life, because I'm fully immersed in the story and can't stop playing. Geralt is an amazing protagonist and all the areas feel so alive with the different characters and details that are put into them. Not only is the main story-line great, the side-quests are basically just as good and memorable. The dlcs feel like another game and have a freaking vampire story?? Only negative is that the combat can feel quite simple and boring at times, but trying to roleplay with potions and sword oils make it a bit more enjoyable. This game isn't really about the combat anyway, but the characters and just exploring the world. Also gwent. I also like that there are different endings and romance options, even though I will never choose the bad endings (Ciri is my child).

After so many hours, so many adventures, so many life lessons.. I wish I had words to describe this game, but I simply don't.
It is the best game I've ever played in my life, it's like a work of art that I'm glad I had the chance to experience.

How do you even review The Witcher 3 in 2025? 

Everyone knows what it is and what it's not. 

Regardless, I played the game fully (Main game + ALL DLCs) for the first time now. It was an excellent experience. It took me around 130 hours, all sidecontent included, on the Death March! difficulty.

I was expecting it to feel ""old"" in some ways, but I was gladly proven wrong quickly. The game looks amazing to this date, maybe due to the ""next gen update"" from 2022. The game looked and sounded great - maybe not as detailed as some newer games, but the art style carried and the design of the rather grim world of The Witcher still feels unmatched to this day. Novigrad especially I was surprised by - the city is vast, full of people and actually feels like a city rather than a level in a video game. 

Gameplay wise I had no real issues. Though the combat wasn't too deep, the variety in which you can build Geralt made up for it's simplicity. I went for a full Sign build (eg. magic) and had a blast weaving in devastating spells, while fending off enemies with parries of the sword and dodges. Death March! added some challenge and in some cases I used oils and bombs to further fight the various enemies and bosses. The best part about the combat was the variety of enemies. The Witcher 3 is full of very different creatures - man or monster - and a lot of different bosses (Witcher contracts mainly) that kept the game fresh throughout. Some recent games I've played had little in the variety department (Dragon Age: The Veilguard) which in those games made combat extremely repetetive. 

Looking past the combat, the game felt fresh due to it's amazing narrative. The story is gripping and every bit of the world feels alive and interesting. It's rare that a game's sidequests have as good or better storylines than the main objective, but the Witcher 3 has that in droves. [b]And this is what the Witcher 3 does best. [/b] The stories. The Wticher, while very action-heavy, is an RPG. There are multiple endings, choices to be made that aren't cut and dry and therefore offer interesting stories to tell. I can't help but compare that approach to the genre again to my recently played games. The Witcher 3 did it better 10 years ago. 

To keep it short and sweet: Banger of a game, 10/10, even in 2025.

As in the two first games, you play the witcher Geralt of Rivia, however, in Witcher 3 you have a great open world to explore in contrast to a closed area or linear map as in the predecessor games. The main story deals with the Wild Hunt and Geralt and associates searching for Ciri, who bears a crucially important power.

The sophisticated main story with its authentic main and side characters and diverse dialogue options is extremely well written and hooks you from the start. I have so thoroughly enjoyed it that I felt somewhat empty and even a bit sad when I finished it, as I knew there was most likely no other RPG being able to deliver something comparable to this marvelous adventure. Sometimes I wish I could forget the main story and play it all over again. Choices made during its course do not only determine the destiny of single characters, but also the future of whole empires. Next to the main quest, The Witcher 3 offers side quest plots that can be experienced before certain events during the main quest and that add a lot of immersion to the world. Most quests offer you different choices and give you the feeling that there is no absolute evil or good, but many shades of gray in an overall harsh world. In my opinion, the only subject that required more attention was the background story and motivation of the main antagonist.

The open world in which this RPG takes place is massive and filled with innumerable smaller side quests. Next to standard side quests, the witcher might also solve problems regarding monsters in special contracts to earn additional experience and funds. The developers have put in tons of effort to create and design as many diverse and interesting monsters as possible, which all have an entry in a bestiary and require a different strategy to be beaten by the witcher. For example, this means that you should brew certain potions to be able to effectively combat various monster types. Furthermore, you can enhance your witcher’s abilities by spending skill points on a diverse set of skills that can all improve your strength. These features increase the immersion of playing as a mutant human that the witcher actually is and thus increase the joy of playing as a true witcher. The very satisfactory feeling of character progression through the course of a playthrough is reinforced by finding and improving an armory set from a witcher school of your own choice. The cities and settlements and the people living in these feel quite vivid, however, you can sometimes notice that the open world and most of its inhabitants can often be more accurately described as a theatric scenery than a consistent and organic world that could also exist on its own. The open world felt quite bland and empty here and there, giving the impression that size mattered more than quality.

The two DLCs of the Witcher 3, Hearts of Stone (HoS) and Blood and Wine (BaW) are both absolutely worth it and actually handle my two main points of criticism quite well: the main antagonist and the open world. While HoS offers only little with regard to exploration of new areas, its story telling and main antagonist, who I would describe as the best written main antagonist up to this date, are the focus points of this expansion. BaW is an expansion that focuses on all strengths of this game and creates a more believable open world that is smaller, but more densely packed with quests and interesting characters. Basically, BaW is a better version of the main game just with smaller proportions. I highly recommend both DLCs to everyone who has played the main game.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is probably the best RPG of the 2010s and one of the best and most memorable RPGs of all time. Everyone who enjoys sophisticated story telling and an authentically written dark and ruthless world full of questionable human beings and dangerous monsters will wholeheartedly enjoy this game.

His mission? To find his wayward apprentice and adopted daughter, Ciri, who has a knack for disappearing at the most inconvenient times. 
Along your journey, you'll meet a host of characters—some eager to help, others eager to use you for their own gain. The world is filled with fascinating personalities, both good and not-so-good, each with their own unique charm. Trust me, you'll want to learn everything about them.

The game is an absolute masterpiece of the RPG genre, boasting an open world so vast and full of life that it’s easy to get lost in it for hours on end. The story is shaped by your decisions, making each playthrough feel unique and deeply personal. You'll find yourself exploring the massive world, taking on monster contracts, solving dungeon puzzles, helping those in need, and, of course, engaging in some risky romances with powerful sorceresses (not the safest idea, but who can resist?) :D

The locations in the game are nothing short of stunning—whether you're roaming through vibrant, colorful landscapes or creeping through dark, terrifying dungeons, the visuals will leave you breathless. (I've taken about a million screenshots, and I regret nothing!) 
Combat is smooth and satisfying, with options to use swords, crossbows, bombs, potions, and signs to decimate your enemies. The mechanics are intuitive, making it a breeze to dive into the action.

Insert '[i]what can I say that hasn't already been[/i]' cliche.  In 250+ hours, all achievements conquered, all maps cleansed of their quests and points of interest, and all dlc content thoroughly explored, I can confidently say I've experienced nearly everything this game has to offer.

This was the one: CDPR's golden child.  I know i'm rather late to the party, but I finally made time to try the game I had heard such an overwhelming amount about over the last decade.  Thankfully, I was not jumping in blind as I have completed both the Witcher 1 and 2 prior to tackling this beast, and would say I enjoyed those a moderate amount.  But this--the Witcher 3--this is the one that has gained a staggeringly strong reputation over the years for being such a strong entry in the fantasy RPG genre.  Needless to say, I went in with rather high expectations.

I'll keep it short and say that those expectations were absolutely met.  The absurd level of detail and effort put into creating a living, breathing world that ensures the player will [i]not[/i] feel like the center of the universe is incredibly respectable, leaving said player with an immensely satisfying and immersive experience.  One that I could not recommend more. . . . . . . .

[h2]IF[/h2]

a primarily story driven game is what resonates with the player.  

To go on a bit of a tangent, every time there's a [i]what's a popular game that you just couldn't get into?![/i] thread on popular gaming sites or reddit, there's always 2 very common answers: Zelda, Breath of the Wild (a discussion for another day..) and the Witcher 3.  That said, despite thoroughly enjoying my time, I have [i]absolutely[/i] come to understand why so many feel they just can't get into this game.

The Witcher 3's biggest strength is that the devs knew exactly what they wanted this game to be.  The engaging story and its themes, the lively cast of characters, the beautifully detailed and immersive world?  All great stuff!  The Witcher 3 as a general experience is undeniably fantastic...

The Witcher 3 as a [i]game[/i]?... Yeeeeah there's just nothing of interest here.   The problem with the devs focusing so hard on creating a believable world is that they doubled down on finely tuning this aspect of the game, leaving the rest of the experience to suffer as a result.  The player can go [i]hours[/i] without interacting with any of the game's core mechanics if they happen to engage in a chain of story-centered quests, which doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as a bad thing, but when they do finally happen upon gameplay, it can feel under cooked.

The open world contains many memorable and varied side quests, admittedly, but contains just as many points of interest that are considered busy work in other games of a similar format.  Combat is often cited as a particularly weak part of the gameplay as it boils down to a very a simplistic dodge-and-counter loop, a complaint I can't disagree with.  There are dozens of armor/weapon sets that all differ [i]only[/i] in numerical stats until the dlc, which by then is too little too late.  Signs, this game's version of magic, are rather one-dimensional and therefore pretty limited in spicing up combat.  There are [i]hundreds[/i] of lootable items, and while not all of them add to the limit, the devs decided on keeping the weight system that plagues so many rpg's.  This isn't a survival game, so no idea why this system exists here.  The list goes on, but I feel the point across.

I can wholeheartedly recommend this title [i]if[/i] and only if the player is aware of what they're getting into.  The Witcher 3 is an experience first and game second.  The devs knew this and if you don't mind that fact, you will be treated to one of the most memorable experiences in gaming.",1716951641,1716951641,True,15,0,0.6897611021995544,1,True,False,False,False,292030,20250114_132020,positive,100

[b]Having never played the previous installments of The Witcher series[/b], I found myself diving into The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with a mix of excitement and trepidation. From the outset, the game felt like a [b]deprecation. The clunky combat mechanics and awkward movement system were immediate turn-offs.[/b] The game's complexity was overwhelming, inundating me with a barrage of new characters and rapidly evolving plot threads before I had even grasped the controls or memorized the key bindings. [b]Each attempt to immerse myself ended in boredom and frustration, as I felt humiliated by my inability to fight, navigate, or make crucial decisions effectively.[/b]

[b]However, as I reached the 50-hour mark, a revelation dawned on me.[/b] The game is designed to be challenging and intricate, and therein lies its allure. The initial struggle became a driving force, compelling me to persevere and master the game's systems. [b]The wooden simplicity of the controls and mechanics faded into the background as I grew accustomed to them, allowing me to focus on exploring the rich, immersive world.[/b]

Delving deeper into the game, [b]I began to truly embody the role of Geralt of Rivia I felt his rage at the world, his complex relationship with Yennefer, and the weight of his quest to find Ciri.[/b] The narrative became a living, breathing experience, with each cutscene evoking genuine emotions—laughter at the witty banter and sorrow at the loss of loved ones. [b]The way Geralt's actions impacted the game world was particularly satisfying, as favors granted to various characters came full circle in the end.[/b]

The soundtrack deserves special mention for its ability to heighten every moment, from the smallest skirmish to the most pivotal plot twist. The characters' loyalty and interconnectedness added depth to the story, making my choices feel significant. Despite the initial shortcomings, these aspects overshadowed the early frustrations.

[b]After spending over 100 hours in the game, completing the main storyline and most side quests[/b], I can confidently say that [b]The Witcher 3's slow-paced development is a double-edged sword[/b]. It may deter new players with its gradual build-up, but it ultimately leads to a crescendo of non-stop action and engagement towards the end, making it hard to step away from the screen—a feeling I never experienced earlier in the game.

In conclusion, [b]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a testament to the rewards of perseverance. Its initial hurdles are daunting, but they give way to a profoundly rich and engaging experience that is well worth the effort.[/b] For those willing to push through the early struggles, the game offers an unparalleled journey filled with emotion, depth, and satisfaction.

The story is definitely simple yet compelling as well as even the side quests (which you should not skip -and i don't think you will do such a thing !), allowing the player to get a feel of a satisfaction somewhat similar to putting together jigsaw puzzle pieces, along with the bigger picture; the end result which is based off many decisions made along the way.

[h2]A Visual Feast That’s Better Than Your Last Vacation Photos[/h2]

From the moment you boot up The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, it’s clear you’re in for a visual treat. The character models aren’t just well-crafted; they’re so expressive you might start questioning if they’re more emotionally available than your ex. And the landscapes? Oh boy, forget your last vacation photos because this game’s scenery makes them look like they were taken with a potato. You’ll find yourself stopping to admire the view so often that Geralt might as well get a side gig as a travel blogger.

[h2]Engaging Systems and Storyline That Make Netflix Binge-Worthy[/h2]

This game isn’t just a pretty face; it’s got brains too. The systems, from alchemy to combat, are designed to keep you on your toes. The storyline balances the grand scale of world politics with personal conflicts so well, you might start thinking about running for office just to have something this interesting in your life. You’ll be torn between chasing after your adopted daughter, Ciri, and diving into political intrigues so juicy they make House of Cards look like a high school student council meeting.

[h2]Combat: Like Dancing with Swords (But Less Graceful)[/h2]

Combat in The Witcher 3 is a dance, a deadly, monster-slaying dance. Geralt’s swordplay is swift and fluid, and with signs and potions in the mix, you’ll feel like a magical martial artist. However, gauging range in combat can be a bit like trying to swat a fly with a broomstick – sometimes you hit the mark, and sometimes you’re just flailing around like you’re at a rave. But when you do connect, oh, the satisfaction is real.

[h2]Weather: Beautiful but Barely There[/h2]

The dynamic weather in The Witcher 3 adds an atmospheric touch that’s as gorgeous as it is irrelevant. Sure, it’s fun to watch a storm roll in, but it could’ve done so much more. Imagine tracking a monster through a blizzard, where the wind isn’t just blowing your hair but your chances of survival. Alas, the weather is more like background noise – pretty but not really making much of a difference. It’s like having a sports car and only using it to drive to the grocery store. I hope it's getting obvious I'm grasping at straws here, trying to find drawbacks.

[h2]An End That Leaves You Wanting More (And Sobbing Uncontrollably)[/h2]

All jokes aside, the biggest downside of The Witcher 3? It ends. After countless hours of engrossing gameplay, rich storytelling, and memorable adventures, you’ll be left staring at the credits, wondering what to do with your life. The realization that your epic journey has a conclusion might have you bargaining with the gaming gods for just one more quest. But like all good things, it’s the journey that matters, even if you’re left with a void that only another replay can fill.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that will have you hooked from the first monster hunt to the final farewell. With its stunning visuals, deep story, and fluid combat, it sets a new standard for RPGs. Whether you’re a veteran witcher or a newcomer, this is one journey you’ll cherish.

It's a monumental experience that sets the gold standard for storytelling, immersion, and depth.
From the very first moments, the world of the Continent has breathtaking scope and detail. The windswept hills of Skellige, exploring the bustling streets of Novigrad, or wandering the hauntingly desolate swamps of Velen, the environments are alive with stories waiting to be discovered. Every corner feels lovingly crafted, every location brimming with atmosphere, history, and purpose. Seriously the lore and world building in this game is nuts especially after you read the books it really makes you feel like you are actually living in the world that Andrzej Sapkowski created.
The storytelling is nothing short of extraordinary. At its core is Geralt of Rivia, a protagonist of unmatched complexity, navigating a world as morally ambiguous as it is beautiful. The main quest—a gripping tale of love, loss, and destiny—is complemented by side quests that could easily stand alone as highlights in lesser games. These aren't mere fetch tasks but richly woven narratives that deepen your connection to the world and its inhabitants. Characters like Ciri, Yennefer, and Triss are so vividly realized that they feel like real people, their emotions, motivations, and conflicts resonating long after you've put down the controller.
Visually, The Witcher 3 is a marvel. Even years after its release, the attention to detail in its landscapes, weather effects, and character designs remains unrivaled. Taking photos of these visual marvels is a big part of what i enjoy so much about this game. The sunsets over Toussaint, the shadowy interiors of monster lairs, and the way the light dances through a forest canopy are all testament to CD Projekt Red's commitment to creating an immersive experience.
And then there are the DLCs, which elevate the game to even greater heights. Hearts of Stone introduces one of the most chilling and enigmatic villain, while Blood and Wine is practically a standalone game in its own right. With its vibrant, fairy tale-inspired setting and a deeply personal story, Blood and Wine provides a fitting swan song for Geralt's journey, offering closure while still leaving you longing for more. And with the Witcher 4 being annouced im eagerly waiting for more news on that and am very excited to play it. This playthrough on steam was my 8th one and ill probably still play more and more i just never get bored of this game :).
The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is not just the best RPG ever made—it is arguably the greatest game of all time. Its fusion of narrative brilliance, world-building, character depth, and visual splendor is unparalleled.

Introduction:
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt stands as a testament to the heights video game storytelling can reach. From its breathtaking visuals to its immersive world and intricate storyline, every facet of this game exudes excellence. With all DLCs and expansions, The Witcher 3 delivers an unforgettable experience that will linger in the minds of players long after the final credits roll.

Main Game: The Wild Hunt
In The Witcher 3's main storyline, players step into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, a seasoned monster hunter, as he embarks on a quest to find his adopted daughter, Ciri, pursued by the otherworldly Wild Hunt. The narrative unfolds in a vast open world, filled with political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and unforgettable characters. From the war-torn landscapes of Velen to the bustling streets of Novigrad and the majestic vistas of Skellige, every corner of the world is meticulously crafted and teeming with life.

The main storyline is a rollercoaster of emotions, blending personal stakes with grand political machinations. Players will find themselves drawn into a web of alliances, betrayals, and unexpected twists as they unravel the mystery of Ciri's heritage and the true nature of the Wild Hunt. Along the way, the game presents players with meaningful choices that shape the world and characters around them, making every decision feel weighty and impactful.

The visual fidelity of The Witcher 3 is nothing short of breathtaking. From the haunting beauty of the haunted swamps to the awe-inspiring architecture of ancient ruins, every environment is rendered with painstaking detail. Character models are equally impressive, with lifelike animations and expressive faces that bring the inhabitants of the world to life. Whether exploring the bustling streets of Novigrad or navigating treacherous forests, the game's visuals never fail to impress.

Expansions:
Hearts of Stone
Hearts of Stone takes players on a dark and twisted journey into the heart of Temeria, where they encounter Gaunter O'Dimm, a mysterious and enigmatic character with a penchant for making Faustian bargains. The expansion introduces a new cast of memorable characters, including the tragic figure of Olgierd von Everec, whose tale of love and loss serves as the emotional core of the storyline.

With its intricate plotlines and morally ambiguous choices, Hearts of Stone offers a refreshing change of pace from the main game. Players will find themselves drawn into a world of deceit and betrayal, where nothing is as it seems and even the most noble intentions can lead to unforeseen consequences.

Blood and Wine
Blood and Wine transports players to the sun-drenched kingdom of Toussaint, a land of chivalry and honor, where they become embroiled in a mystery involving a series of gruesome murders. As Geralt delves deeper into the investigation, he uncovers a dark secret lurking beneath the surface of this seemingly idyllic paradise.

With its vibrant colors and picturesque landscapes, Blood and Wine offers a stark contrast to the grim and war-torn world of the main game. But beneath its facade of beauty lies a story of corruption and decay, as players navigate the treacherous politics of Toussaint and uncover the true nature of the monsters that haunt its streets.

Conclusion:
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, along with its DLCs and expansions, stands as a crowning achievement in the world of video game storytelling. With its richly detailed world, compelling characters, and intricate plotlines, it offers an experience that is as emotionally resonant as it is intellectually stimulating.

While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".

And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?

And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feel I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this.

Character models are intricately designed, and the monsters you encounter are both terrifying and awe-inspiring. The graphics, even years after the games release, continue to stand the test of time.

The storytelling in The Witcher 3 and its DLC's are among the best narratives out there. Filled with complex characters, choices that makes you question morality and each dialogue or action have their consequences that shapes your tale. Every corner of the map is teeming with quests, mysteries, and hidden treasures. The side quests are not distractions but are tied to the main story, offering players a chance to explore the depths of the world and its lore. Whether you're hunting mythical creatures or solving mysteries, every quest feels meaningful and contributes to the overall story of the game.

The combat system is both challenging, fun and really satisfying. Movements and fighting feels so fluid with a big variety of combat styles to suit everyone, from sword fighting, spells, ranged and potions allowing players to really strategize. It's a perfect balance between accessibility for newcomers and complexity for seasoned players.

The sound design and music is something truly special and deserve a big praise! The music is especially haunting combined with the atmospheric sounds and have a huge emotional impact on every moment.

[b]Immersive Gameplay[/b]
The gameplay mechanics are equally impressive. Combat is fluid and satisfying, combining strategic planning with fast-paced action. Geralt's Witcher abilities, combined with a wide array of weapons and magic, allow for diverse combat styles that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. The variety of quests, from the main story to side missions and monster contracts, are all crafted with care and provide a deep and rewarding experience.

[b]A Living, Breathing World[/b]
One of the game’s greatest achievements is its open world. The Witcher 3’s world is teeming with life and detail, filled with unique characters, each with their own stories and secrets. The attention to detail is staggering, making exploration a joy. Whether you are uncovering hidden treasures, solving intricate puzzles, or simply taking in the stunning landscapes, there is always something new to discover.

[b]Unforgettable Characters[/b]
The characters in The Witcher 3 are unforgettable. Geralt himself is a complex and nuanced protagonist, and the supporting cast is equally memorable. Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and a host of other characters are all well-developed, each with their own unique personalities and arcs. The voice acting and writing are top-notch, bringing these characters to life in a way that few games achieve.

[b]Heartfelt Music[/b]
The musical score is another highlight, perfectly complementing the game’s tone and atmosphere. The hauntingly beautiful melodies stay with you long after you’ve put down the controller, enhancing the emotional impact of the story.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Its combination of a deeply engaging story, stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and rich character development makes it an unforgettable experience.

I had the time to play and read every game/book since, so I was able to get the full experience.
It added an extra something, but fear not, it is far from a necessity to enjoy the game (even if I recommend at least taking a glance).

After a long adventure, the big question you wish an answer to then appears: Was it worth it?
Yes, it was, however it's not a perfect game and I'll break down several of its aspects to elaborate my point.

Starting with the narration and story, it had some high highs and a fair consistency in quality all around. Every dialogue had production value, but it also creates an issue where you will spend a lot of time watching a film or it pushes you to skipreading (skip the line when you read it to keep the pace, quite frequent while going through voice acted visual novel games or segments).
There was care put into having a lot of details to influence with choices, even if it lacked some of the more meaningful ones due to most being self contained bits, in terms of major choices I think the second game was more interesting with some really difficult positions to cut on and strong characters(Foltest, Letho, Iorveth, Roche, even Henselt and more).
Despite all that, it's still quite solid and entertaining to go along, with the exception of the final chapters falling off, likely due to the dev time coming short and needing to cut plans.

Gwent is a major part of the game even as an optional minigame, and while it is a bit goofy to play against some characters at awkward timings, you never say no to a round of gwent. Honestly it would have been funny to defeat Caranthir in Gwent instead.
I came from having played the multiplayer Gwent and the spinoff witcher game based on it, so I was a veteran to the rules and that meant it was overall very easy to me. This version was quite apparent as the prototype with more basic mechanics and terribly unbalanced exploits but that didn't prevent it from being addictive, really hoping to get a new gwent game one day.
Would've been nice to have a better way to track card locations and not have missable cards.

For the other kind of battles, compared to the previous entries, there was a clear technical improvement and better strategy to employ with the various bestiary. Balance was likely set on the easier scale for sure, considering even in Death March I was completely broken despite restricting signs to only Yrden (and the other ones didn't look weaker) and not using bombs too much.
The roll distance was a bit annoying at times, and likely because backstep dodge is what you should use for most situations, but my souls brain is hardwired sadly, it did make me realize its potential though. I liked the various weaknesses to exploit against enemies, even if not all was accurate and some enemies' biggest weaknesses weren't even marked (or worse, the opposite where it tells you Yrden is effective against the Ofieri Mage when he negates it, or Igni against Archespores when they just go away if on fire).
Target lock is quite abysmal, and I just didn't bother using it. I wished it would show when your items are damaged earlier and not wait to be half broken to tell you the stats are worsened.

Speaking of gear, the crafting is in a strange place with alchemy being the most essential and fairly easy to ignore the rest aside the witcher school gear. 
There are a lot of ingredients needed and to find, which should tingle my fancy usually, but here it was so abundant everywhere, combined with shops that had literally everything related, the fun of crafting was reduced to hunting for specific monsters for that one ingredient.
In the end it was another upgrade system, and you didn't even get to craft things for your home in B&W, spending materials somewhere. Not exploited enough.

Although something was really benefited was the looting, this game is dangerous for looting addicts, and if you're not, you become one. The first thing you will think of in a new room after a cutscene is to rob the place. I will partly blame the witcher senses for that, it's too hard to resist when it's available.
There are probably too many spread out loot containers as well, so it becomes a grinding task for little reward, and too much time relying on witcher senses, both a blessing and a curse.
As I mentioned before however, extreme abundance and supermarket shops mean most of the looting is pointless and only accumulating barrel scraps even if you can't stop it at the end of the game. It's a bit funny and awkward that you can anger the guards from stealing, but 90% of the time it's just free to take.
This is probably the main aspect I wished higher difficulty would impact, reducing the abundance, making important crafts much harder to make.

Of course I can't mention the looting without exploration, the backbone of open world. It was a joy to find all the different places and interesting locations, especially supported by the side quests. There were problems hard to avoid though, the main one being that every point of interest had a marker and all the markers' positions were shown at once if you checked boards.
This made it too similar to ubisoft style open world exploration, and stopped being about finding interesting places and only traveling from one marker to another. Skellige being the biggest offender with a ton of pointless loot caches in the seas, cut down more than half and you don't lose anything.
It would have felt better if markers only appeared on the map after being found, and the radar detection being a more hidden/complicated reward to show a handful of spots you haven't seen.
Imagine if Skyrim showed you every location marker for each hold when you enter it, how different it would be. It doesn't even count the smaller spots as worthy of a marker, but it felt like Witcher 3 was afraid of you missing a single one.

The DLC deserve their own section because they're honestly incredible, and even fix (partially) some of the problems mentioned above. Hearts of Stone has easily the best, condensed, rich story of the game with colorful side characters and dreadful main ones (in a good sense). The rest is more standard, but that's still good content, my only regret would be that it's a bit too easy to [spoiler]want to save Olgierd because the devil is too sadistic in making people miserable, despite the responsibility involved. It lacks creepy ambiguity to the character.[/spoiler]
Blood and Wine meanwhile goes the whole Solstheim route and provides a full isolated landmass with all the content going with it. It goes the extra mile by adding a whole new gwent faction (my second favorite), many more new things and even mechanics.
The story and side quests were also quite great even coming out of HoS, I went for [spoiler]full tragedy this time because I felt it was irredeemable, intentionally not revealing something and it was an emotional delight to have the option to split the flowers[/spoiler]. It also completely eradicated the looting issue by cramming a lot into one-pack containers and severely reducing their amount, increasing yield for lower menial steps.
What it failed however, was the ubisoft exploration by having a lot of misc spots that you had to find, and while they tried to make it worth it with a neat story page or book each time, one each time was probably too much and I kinda stopped reading at a point.
It's fine to have misc spots without a story, just like we don't have to find every small point of interest, and I felt it made the exploration suffer when the landscape looked such a delight to wander in.

In conclusion, this was an incredible experience, I couldn't stop. And while I went in details for things that could've been better, it's a pale figure compared to what I enjoyed.

The writing, performances and visuals are nearly impeccable, and it has the most fully realised game world I have ever experienced. And somehow it all feels so effortless and natural. It never feels like its trying to hard to impress or surprise, and yet it did from the first scene to the last. Being Geralt in W3 is easily the coolest role i've ever played in a game.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action-adventure RPG based on the prose by Andrzej Sapkowski. It follows the story of legendary monster slayer Geralt of Rivia as he travels the Continent and beyond in search of his and Yennefer's adopted daughter, Ciri. Set in a beautiful open world and backed up by great storytelling, this is a compelling singleplayer experience that any fan of video games should experience at least once.

[h2]On the run from the Hunt[/h2]

The main story of the Witcher 3 takes us through the quiet landscape of White Orchard, along the battle-ridden and destroyed land of Velen all the way to the pyres of Novigrad located within Redania. The path is long and the open world can be explored at will. Any village, outpost or cave Geralt enters can have something unique, which will be useful in the battle against the Wild Hunt.

[b]Positives:[/b]
+ Compelling storyline that stays true to its source material but never tries to intersect with it. It is a fitting final chapter in Geralt's story that should leave both fans of the novels and newcomers satisfied.
+ Characters are interesting and complex. Whether it is Geralt's true love Yennefer or his dear friend Dandelion, everyone feels in place in the game's story without ever straying too far from their novel origins.
+ Fantastic and rich open world that can be explored at will. The world is your main source of income, whether you accept a lucrative contract or decide to search deep within a cave for lost witcher diagrams, curiosity will always reward you with something, even if it takes your life in the process.
+ A complex combat system that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Playing on lower difficulties will allow you to pass combat encounters with ease, but crank it up to ""Death March"" and you will soon find out that picking the right swords, signs and oils will be the only way to come out of that encounter alive.
+ Character development is in a league of its own. There are so many possibilities for different playstyles, a huge number of abilities one can master to suit their own preferences. I personally had a lot of fun making my sign build.
+ An enormous amount of quests, contracts and tasks for the witcher to do. You can stumble on a simple contract requiring you to free up a village from a nasty monster or end up in a chain of side quests that sometimes take a few hours to complete.
+ Graphics, especially with the next-gen update are great and not too demanding even for weaker PCs. There is always the option to run the old-gen version as well, in the unlikely scenario where you are totally not able to run this one.
+ Music and ambient sounds are a joy to listen to, especially when exploring the Continent.
+ Gwent is a fun pastime once you have understood the rules and know how to play properly. There are a number of side quests and achievements that heavily focus on it though, which did get repetitive for me.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
- There are many issues during cutscenes. Most of the time the game does not unload peds around a cutscene trigger. That means that when you start a cutscene you will often have random NPCs doing goofy or buggy animations while you are trying to listen to important story elements. This is especially common for cutscenes in dense areas such as taverns or streets in Novigrad.
- There are many reused faces, which you will notice quite quickly if you do side quests. This does not apply to any of the important/story/unique characters, they all have their own detailed faces. NPCs, merchants, random quest givers are the ones that suffer from this. It can ruin the immersion!
- Gwent card collection is a bit of a pain to do, if you care for achievements that is. You can easily lock yourself out of the achievement by progressing further into the story and there is no way to go back, unless you have made a manual save prior to the quest that locked you out.

[b]Overall:[/b]
The main Witcher 3 game is a fantastic story-driven experience that pushes the limits of what RPGs can be. All of this, by the way, comes from someone who is neither much into RPGs nor into fantasy in general. That alone should tell you how impressive and great this game is. It is a pinnacle in singleplayer experiences and I would wholeheartedly recommend it even if it costed $70. These days you can grab the Complete Edition for something as low as $10 or $15.

[h2]Hearts of Stone[/h2]

This is the first expansion pack (not DLC) for The Witcher 3. It is an adaptation of a Polish folktale regarding the devil and the consequences of one's wish. Geralt's contact with a cursed nobleman, Olgierd von Everec, take him on a trip around Oxenfurt where he slowly learns what it means to have a heart of stone.

[b]Positive and negative points listed beneath the expansions are things specific only to them. Most of the points mentioned in the main game section also apply to the expansions as they are still part of the same package.[/b]

[b]Positives:[/b]
+ Fanstastic story that is my personal favorite in the whole game. It's full of deep heartbreaking moments but also some fun and even goofy ones as well (whoever plays it will know exactly what I mean).
+ Further expanded combat and character abilities. The runewright has some of the best armor enchantments in the game, provided you have the initial coin to set him up.
+ Some of the music, especially in the Painted World, is a great companion piece to a great quest.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
Nothing specific that isn't part of the main game's issues.

[b]Overall:[/b]
The Hearts of Stone expansion is my favorite part of The Witcher 3, specifically because of its story. With the further refined combat and character progression it is an absolute must that you play this too alongside the base game. The Complete Edition is your friend as it includes both expansions along with the main game.

[h2]Blood and Wine[/h2]

The second and final expansion of the Witcher 3 is a fitting send off for our protagonist. Geralt is taken to the region of Toussaint, a land of wine and love, where he has to undertake one of the biggest contacts of his life. The scale of this expansion is so large, almost the size of a separate project.

[b]Positive and negative points listed beneath the expansions are things specific only to them. Most of the points mentioned in the main game section also apply to the expansions as they are still part of the same package.[/b]

[b]Positives:[/b]
+ Great finale to our hero's journey. While the Hearts of Stone story is my favorite, you can't go wrong with any narrative arc in The Witcher 3.
+ Massive overhaul of character progression and combat in this expansion. New Witcher mutations for Geralt to play around with, grandmaster quality Witcher gear and dyes to look the part while slaying monsters and bandits.
+ Proper vineyard where our hero can rest, harvest plants and tend to his armor and weapons (I don't want to give out too much as this is part of the story).
+ Another great soundtrack, especially ambient music when traversing the pretty landscapes of this southern paradise.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
- Yet more Gwent card collection related quests. Unlike the base game, however, you can collect all cards of the new Skellige deck at any point during your playthrough.

[b]Overall:[/b]
The closing chapter in Geralt's journey is a satisfying ending to the Witcher trilogy. With its massive scale and overhaul of gameplay, this is another must-play for everyone who thinks of picking up the game. If it wasn't clear yet, the Complete Edition is what you want to purchase. All of the content is absolutely worth it if you want the full experience. The game goes on sale very frequently so you have no excuse to not pick it up.

AND it still has some issues, even after the next-gen update.
First of all, as you may have heard, it's a great game. But not because of the combat, gamepaly or the RPG elements, but because of the world, the story and feeling. And probably mainly because of some of the side quests, since the main story doesn't go anywhere for quite a while and is quite redundant 

But anyway, how about a few things that really aren't that great. a negative review should list the negative things after all, right? 
Well, the levelling system is... bad, levelling isn't fun and doesn't feel rewarding, especially because you don't just have to unlock the skill, you have to equip it, and you're very limited by that amount. There's even a single skill that changes the interactions in conservation that you have to equip in order to use it. The way it works means that you have to focus on a few skills, which severely limits the potential for variety. Oh, and you get way too strong for combat pretty quickly. This is why people recommend the harder modes, as it can get boring otherwise. I mean, I was able to kill a boss monster twice my level in 3 igi casts. it could not even move. on the second hardest mode. And the crossbow is useless. you only use it under water and to get down airborn enemies.  
also, the controls are really not meant for the keyboard. after 150 hours i still don't know how to switch between jogging and walking except on accident, same goes for heavy and fast attacks. sometimes you control the direction Roach goes with the mouse and camera angle, sometimes just with the keyboard.  
oh and there are bugs, in numbers that are impossible to ignore even after the next gen update/patch. nothing bad or game breaking MOST of the time, like loot disappearing after loading, NPCs stuck in an animation you can't interact with, merchants not having a marker, things not being visible (weird in cutscenes), Roach sporning in under water. Your inventory will fill up with quest items that you can't get rid of, even though the quests are already completed, and some of the quest items are no longer marked as essential. Some items were never marked as essential (mostly treasure maps) or are marked as essential even though they’re not special at all. Okay fine and all, BUT
I even have a bug that prevents me from finishing a quest. The trigger isn’t there, and it seems like the bug has always been there.
To me, this just feels like sloppy work.
But now I can understand where all the issues that Cyberpunk had, and still has, are coming from.
For instance, this game doesn’t really have any AI or system around theft. At first, you run around looting everything, even if the owner is standing right next to you. They won’t even complain or say anything. But then a guard will attack you for it. And after that you either stop looting random things or just keep gambling if a guard wants to stop you from stealing. Sometimes some guards attack while others just watch, sometimes they all attack, and sometimes they don’t care at all. No system behind it. It seems like some chests are marked as ‘theft if looted,’ while others aren’t, and they just used random ones without paying attention to which was which. Even when you start a fight, the NPCs hardly react. Just like in Cyberpunk, they only run away screaming for a few meters, although at least the animations here are better.

All in all, it’s still a great game, you’ll feel it, and it’s on its way to becoming a GOAT. But in the end, Witcher 2 was the better game; it’s a shame it didn’t get the same attention.

Also, a sign of not-so-good gameplay: less than half the player base even finished the prologue.

Alas, the game truly isn't that bad. It's got a decent enough main story, though most of the fun can be experienced through the side quests you can undertake, which really give a sense of life to the world. From funny little NPC quests to the DLC side stories, I found it all very enjoyable to experience, accompanied by some good music and Geralt's silky smooth, gruff voice.

Sadly, the most important part of this game came up lacking for me, as the combat felt bland, repetitive, and easy. Even adjusting the difficulty just didn’t do it for me. The best thing about the gameplay is probably Gwent when used as a short acronym for ""Gwent to hang myself of boredom,"" because slogging through this 50+ hour mess sadly isn’t worth it. The game has a lot of cool attempted mechanics for fighting monsters, making you try to make concoctions and tinker with your setup to fight them. However, this just feels completely unnecessary and skippable, as the combat is easily done without it, and collecting the ingredients feels like a bore.

People are very passionate about this game. They say the story and the gameplay and the world is brilliant.

I disagree with these people. 

The story and lore are two separate things. The story consists of the events that unfold in the game. The lore is background information that contributes to worldbuilding and backstories that make the world feel more convincing and alive. I need the story to be good for me to care about the lore. How am i supposed to care about what happened to the main character in the past if you can't get me to care about whats happening to him now? 

The story does not entice me at all. I love games that have tight emotional scripts that feel like long movies. They should have an internal conflict and a philosophical conflict paired with the external conflict. This game really only had an external conflict I felt. 

The game asks you to care for the main character who shows no personality at all. He has a recurring joke that he hates portals. That's it. That's the joke. And he says it several times during the story in a monotone voice and it is supposed to be funny.  

Aside from the story, the combat felt fun at the beginning, but after a few hours, i realized that all you had to do to win most battles was use 1 spell and spam attacks. Maybe i should have played on a harder difficulty, but i don't know. The combat system itself is flawed.

On a surface level game is fine until one starts to look more closely into the nature of things.

First and foremost, I want to blast progression system. It's just bad to the point, where it's almost redundant to have. Since players cannot re-define what Witcher is, choices on shaping the playstyle are very limited and it comes to one of three designs - build based on attacks and combat mechanics, build based on the usage of cooldowns of the 5 spells you have or consumable-based build that relies on alchemy part of the game - and this assuming one won't hybrydize it at some point. So basically you always play the same.

Then it comes the aspect of exploration, that is mandatory and not at the same time. It's personal prefference if one likes 3000 map markers that lead them everywhere. Recipes, money and materials are things that might not be obligatory, but power-ups from Places of Power are - and if you're playing blind you have to waltz through most of the stuff to find them. I was getting tired of it after White Orchards, couldn't get assed to seek them later. This exploration doesn't spark any curiosity, it's just a map marker chase to get that 30/30 objectives done.

Economy is another issue I have with the game. Money is worth something, that's good. However, the plethora of money-sinks is just funny if one thinks about it. Gear breaking after few encounters, drop hundred coins to repair it. Want to craft something? Disasemble stuff, it costs. Then for crafting you pay something more. Wrong Blacksmith? Seek another one. Sometimes even number of quests don't pay the price of repair and ever-present nibbling on players pocket basically encourage to either not buy a thing, cheese money, grith teeth and play until it ceases to be the problem or run the side-objectives on the map.

Lastly, music and sound design. It's good, the score is good... until one has to listen to it in the game during few hours session. The morose melodies that game blasts at player are so goddamn draining that i just welcome ANY change to the track that game has to offer. The combat music is upbeat and cheerful in comparison to what exploration music offers - and horse race theme is like a choir of angels in the depresing world of the game. I mean, I've read all the books from the witcher series, back in 2008 and while world in it wasn't the most cheerful place - it didn't looked that bad. 

Probably I'll play it more after the review to finish it just to be done with it and never touch again - but I don't think it's gonna be any better.

Load a game, crash. Eat too much food, crash. Also, enjoy the visual bugs, every play through, guaranteed. So many new bugs too. Camera zooming in and out on its own non-stop.

On everything, I am not even excited for whatever CD is cooking up. Next time they ""NeXt-gEn"" patch any game, beg them to leave it alone. This is insane.

It had a semblance of character/intrigue and while it certainly lacked in the combat department it was still light-years more engaging and fun than whatever the combat system is in TW2/TW3. At least in the original you had to aim to hit what you were wanting to attack. In the sequels when you press the attack button while facing away from an enemy you will do a backflip-aerial-gainer(Squirrel style) and while Geralt is flipping around like a gymnast he will pull out his sword, auto-target the nearest enemy, and slash them. No need to use the joystick to point in any meaningful direction. Just mash the attack button and you are good to go. Sure the Witcher series has some saucy scenes but this is not the type of game you should be able to play one handed.

It did not spark any joy or excitement in me. It has very repetitive & tedious elements that get in the way of gameplay & progression. What do I mean? 

1) The large number of unnecessary items that are collectible. Having to deal with sorting through the mostly useless junk & weapons you collect.

2) Every mission is go talk to this person then kill something/someone then talk to this other person and do it again & again, I never feel like I'm making progress. You're always being set on sopme wild goose chase to find someone or something, I find in most cases it is purely for the sake of lengthening quests, to appear like there is more content.

3) You'll always have to go back to blacksmith frequently to repair your swords which lose durability pretty quickly, particularly the monster killing silver sword, since it's hard to find others of its kind in the world compared to the regular steel sword. This does nothing but get in the way of progress & discourage engaging with combat, which should be a fun & exciting aspect of the game. This is especially true given that blacksmiths can only be found in certain towns, not all of them. These 3 points explain the game loop, which is going on quests, always having to frequently comeback to the same area in order to access the blacksmith & sell the plethora of junk you probably collected on your small adventure & do it again.

4) The controls are clunky, absolutely terrible. Combat, & just generally moving doesn't feel fun. I'm very sure that I wouldn't have been bothered by my 2nd point if atleast the combat & movement was fun, but it ain't.

What I would prefer for this game, would be a significantly better movement system, including animations & responsiveness. A reduction in the number of items that are collectible in the world, & needing to frequent the blacksmith & towns less, which just ruins the momentum of exploration.

Well, for only $10. I'm glad I didn't spend more than that but I wish I would have been able to save my time as well. I'm sure its a fun game for many, the reviews seem to indicate as such. But for me, as other negative reviews do point out, it has too many issues or things that make it not fun for me. 

Positives: There is a good story in there with some good acting. The world is rich and beautiful and big.

Negatives: Combat sucks. I was playing on easy mode and still getting hammered and dying without having a chance to figure out what I was fighting and what I needed to do. Yeah, there's a skill issue, hence playing easy mode, but also I don't have time for trial and error gameplay because I'm an adult with limited time. That's beside the point though, since it was a pain in the arse to assign skills and stuff, blocking/parrying was about useless half the time, and movement was like wading through molasses in January. And so much dialogue. I don't know that I was actually playing much or just button pressing through dialogue. The pacing is off. Side quests didn't seem to well with the main quest, meaning you have to do a bunch of backtracking. And be careful about running into higher level mobs when exploring. Loot so far is well below expectations too. Nothing compelling. 

Gosh, there is just so much I don't like but I really wanted to like this game. There is good lore there. But I just can't slog through it. I played through Assassin's Creed Odyssey recently and really enjoyed that game. I wanted to like Valhalla and couldn't. And I didn't want to spend money on Mirage knowing things were kind of mixed. So, I was kind of hoping this game would scratch that itch. It's close, but still leaves me scratching. 

In the end, movement and combat overall could have been better. Story pacing and leveling could be improved.But mostly it was feeling like I was playing the story/dialogue parts more than the actually game parts.

Most of the quests have multiple ways to handle and there are consequences.  Followers could take action without your instruction so beware.  

The combat system is quite unique.  You can play either as FPS / action game or strategic game.  Both are viable.

Okay, right off the bat, I believe Fallout: New Vegas is not just the best modern Fallout game, but also one of the best RPG's of all time. Graphically, New Vegas definitely appears to have aged like milk, but if you can remember, the graphics were pretty dated when the game initially launched. Despite this, the world, unique characters, lore rich narrative, several endings for main and side quests, focus on player agency, etc. all keep players both new and old playing, even 14 years later. New Vegas is one of the most prime examples of an RPG game done almost perfectly, at least in regard to narrative. The range of possible ways that you can solve all kinds of different quest is pretty insane sometimes, and you can literally see the end credits without killing a single person.
The biggest gripes I hear about New Vegas in 2024 is the graphics and general jank of the engine. While it doesn't excuse it, if you know anything about the development of New Vegas, then you should know that it at least partially explains why things are as they are. This would of course be a more significant problem if Fallout: New Vegas didn't have such amazing mod support. There are mods and mod packs that do everything from patching the most basic issues, all the way to completely overhauling the game, bringing the gameplay to the same quality of the astounding story. Regardless of whether you think you might have a preference for a vanilla or a 500+ mods New Vegas playthrough, the story and dense activity within this wasteland is simply one that must be experienced by EVERYONE!

TL;DR:

New Vegas is one of the greatest RPG's of all time, and despite being graphically unimpressive, the narrative and game world make up for it tenfold, with or without mods.

Stability is going to be a factor for most people playing this game, so I thought I'd talk about my experience having played this exclusively on the Steam Deck with no mods. FPS on maxed settings was consistently around 60. There were no instances of stuttering. On occasion, while in VATS, the game would freeze for a couple seconds, and during the endgame, it crashed twice during area transitions. The DLC crashed a bit more, but I detailed that in the reviews I previously wrote for each.

So all in all, performance was shockingly great. It was definitely a bug ridden mess on console, and I understand it hasn't responded well to newer PC rigs either, but New Vegas seems well suited to being played through Proton.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3231241948

As far as the actual game experience, it still held up perfectly well. It's a game that despite having aged significantly, still looks great, plays great, and sounds great. In many ways, this is still superior to plenty of modern era games.

Which isn't to say it is without issues. Depending on the order in which you complete quests, the dialogue might still assume you are in an earlier stage of the game, and with so many different things possible, the game does get confused by player actions at times. That's one of the more notable issues. Also, the open world traversal isn't always seamless. Sometimes for example, you can be on just the other side of a ridge from an area or objective, but you can't go over the ridge. Instead, you have to trek all the way around lol.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3237381639

Regardless of the above though, most of the systems in the game compliment each other and work well even today. I'd guess this game still has quite a number of years of life left in it. You might have to work to get it running, but once you do, it's a quality game that deserves to be experienced by everyone. It's a true and legendary piece of gaming history. Do yourself a favor and buy the Ultimate Edition though rather than buying the DLC separate, if you don't already own it. It's a huge step up from the base game version as far as content available.

If you're looking to get into the franchise for the first time, or are already a fan of the franchise but haven't given New Vegas a go, I would highly recommend this game. For example if you've only ever played the classic games, this game acts as an almost direct sequel to fallout 2, taking some characters and plot threads from that game, and expanding upon them here as a sort of finale to the west coast chapter of this franchise. If you're a Fallout 3 fan, and want to experience West Coast fallout, but can't quite get into the isometric games, Fallout New Vegas has you covered since it runs on the same engine and has the same mechanics as Fallout 3. If you're a fan of Fallout 4, and want to experience [strike] a better game [/strike] the previous installments of the franchise, this is a perfect game to start with. If you've never played a fallout game before, that's OK, because if you don't know anything about the lore, this game will help you out to become more accustomed to the franchise. Fallout New Vegas also includes a wonderful story with social commentary like all of the Fallout titles, Excellent characters that feel more real than most games, a stellar cast, great and memorable factions, and an ending plus DLC that will leave you craving more.

In my opinion, it’s the best first/third-person RPG ever made, and I’ve played my fair share of RPGs. This game doesn't just meet industry standards, it surpasses them in every possible way. The writing is sharp, the characters are unforgettable, and the main and side quests are woven with such depth that it feels like every choice truly matters. The music and atmosphere immerse you in a post-apocalyptic world like no other, and the dark humor brings a unique charm that never gets old.

Playing through New Vegas is always a wild and deeply rewarding journey, no matter how many times I return to it. Even now, 14 years after its release, no similar game has come close to topping it, and I genuinely don't think anything will in the foreseeable future.

There’s a reason this game is revered by the gaming community. It’s a masterpiece that has stood the test of time, and for good reason.

Don't get me wrong, Fallout New Vegas is a MASTERPIECE. (which I realize I tend to use that word a lot in my reviews, but this title truly deserves it) It oozes atmosphere out of every pore, the story is amazing, the characters are interesting, yadda yadda yadda...
But it is SO unstable. Even by Bethesda standards. The game crashed on me all the time and so many bugs impeded my experience. I probably lost a total of 10 hours of progress to save corruptions. And this is after all these years of patches and bug fixes. I had to install a lot of mods just to get this game to a stable condition. But what if some people aren't that technically inclined? What if they can't figure out how to install all the script extenders, unofficial patches, etc.? Then they're just screwed.

In its vanilla state, this game is unacceptably broken. And if we're being honest with ourselves, the core gameplay loop didn't exactly age well. Pretty much every objective is go here, talk to this person, go there, rinse and repeat. If it wasn't for the outstanding dialogue and writing, this game would be outright tedious.
 It is important to keep in mind though, FNV had a seriously tumultuous development. Bethesda was not kind in the slightest to Obsidian while making this, and personally, I am dumbfounded they managed to make something this magical with the hand they were dealt. In fact, one of the only dynamically designed quests in the game also happens to be one of the buggiest, so I don't hold this flaw against the game at all - making the entire gameplay loop as open ended and choice based as ""Beyond the Meat"" was literally impossible with the engine they were working with and the time they had.
As for the bugs, though, consumers have the right to a reasonably polished product. More than 10 years after its release, I would expect this game to be way more stable than it is.
All that being said, I can't in good conscience not recommend this game. Its a work of art, full of clever writing and endearing characters. Even if the mission design is outdated, its still fun to run around and start random fire fights with random a-holes.

[i] Fallout: New Vegas [/i] is the epitome of what an RPG should be—deep, immersive, and endlessly replayable. Set in a post-apocalyptic Mojave Desert, this game offers a rich, branching narrative that is packed with complex characters, moral ambiguity, and choices that genuinely affect the world around you.

The writing is top-notch, with a level of wit and dark humor that keeps you engaged through every quest. The factions and their conflicting interests create a dynamic world where your decisions truly matter. Whether you’re siding with the NCR, the Legion, or going your own way, the outcomes are diverse and impactful.

The gameplay is a perfect blend of RPG mechanics and first-person action. The V.A.T.S. system returns, allowing for tactical combat, while the addition of hardcore mode adds a layer of realism for those looking for an extra challenge. The weapon customization and crafting systems are deep without being overwhelming, giving you plenty of ways to personalize your experience.

The atmosphere in [i] New Vegas [/i] is phenomenal. From the neon-lit Strip to the eerie silence of the desert, the game excels at creating a world that feels both alive and desolate. The soundtrack complements this perfectly, with a mix of haunting ambient tracks and classic tunes from the golden age of radio.

Despite its age, [i] Fallout: New Vegas [/i] remains one of the best RPGs ever made. Yes, there are a few bugs here and there, but they are far outweighed by the game’s strengths. The level of freedom, the depth of storytelling, and the replayability make this a must-play for any fan of the genre.

If you’ve never experienced [i] New Vegas[/i], now is the perfect time to dive in. And if you have, there’s always something new to discover on your next playthrough.

My first game in the series was Fallout 4 and I really liked it. I would see Fallout: New Vegas every now and again on the Steam store but completely ignore it since it appeared outdated compared to 4. I was truly deceived. 

Before I continue I want to mention that my playthrough was completely vanilla. I had no mods at all installed.

It took me a few hours to get into the momentum of this game. I was not super focused on the story or dialog, skipping through it in order to get to the action quicker. I kept thinking ""These graphics suck"" and ""This gun play is lame."" But on hour 4, something just clicked. I started reading the dialog, understanding the story, exploring and reading misc items. It all flowed so well, and not only that, it was fun. Learning about the different factions was genuinely interesting. Finding a random town, vault, camp, outpost, etc. they all felt unique. Every single character I came across had their own story and purpose, each offering different quests. Not only that, the world changes as you progress and you actually witness it in your surroundings. 

The quests were actually good. The quests did not simply consist of ""fetch me this"" or ""eliminate that."" Each one had a plot, some even twists. A large majority of quests even let YOU decide how to play it through. There is optional objectives that will lead to a different end result. Sometimes you'd have to pick to help one over the other. You could use violence or you could be peaceful using speech. There are so many ways to go through each quest line which only allows for more replayability. 

Compared to Fallout 4, this game's quests and world actually have a soul. (I do not mention this only to compare, but also because there are many Fallout 4 fans that might view New Vegas as outdated based off the Steam store.) 

This is a must play game. If you are not used to games like this, it might take a few hours to truly invest yourself in it. Once you do though, you will enjoy every hour of it. Can't wait to play the DLC. 10/10

Developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released in 2010, the game has garnered enduring acclaim for its deep narrative complexity, expansive world-building, and the sheer freedom it offers to players.

One of the most striking aspects of ""Fallout: New Vegas"" is its commitment to player agency. The game is set in a meticulously crafted version of the Mojave Wasteland, where every decision the player makes has tangible consequences. Whether choosing alliances between factions or determining the fate of the New Vegas Strip, each choice is loaded with significance, allowing for a truly personalized gaming experience. This non-linear approach to storytelling is a hallmark of RPGs, yet ""New Vegas"" elevates it to an art form, ensuring that no two playthroughs are ever the same.

The game’s narrative is another highlight, featuring a compelling mix of political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and dark humor. The writing is sharp, often evoking the themes of classic Westerns while intertwining them with the dystopian elements that ""Fallout"" fans have come to expect. Characters are complex and well-developed, with motivations that extend beyond the usual tropes, making interactions feel meaningful and immersive.

Mechanically, ""Fallout: New Vegas"" builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors, refining the V.A.T.S. combat system and introducing new gameplay elements, such as weapon customization and a reputation system. These innovations not only enhance the combat experience but also deepen the role-playing elements, further immersing players in the world. The addition of survival mechanics, such as Hardcore Mode, adds another layer of challenge for those seeking a more immersive experience.

Visually, while the game may show its age compared to modern titles, the art direction remains impressive. The desolate beauty of the Mojave Wasteland is captured through a distinct visual style that balances the bleakness of a nuclear-ravaged world with the vibrant neon of New Vegas, creating an atmosphere that is both haunting and captivating.

In conclusion, ""Fallout: New Vegas"" is a standout entry in the ""Fallout"" series and a must-play for any fan of RPGs. Its intricate narrative, vast open world, and emphasis on player choice make it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with gamers more than a decade after its release.

This is my 3rd playthrough since playing this game on old XBOX, so this is a review on VANILLA Fallout New Vegas (no mods, no bug fixes, no nothing).

This Fallout is my favorite Fallout so far since it obeys actual RPG mechanics and obeys the source material from previous Fallout games (Fallout 1 & 2), it does come present with bugs like ALL Bethesda games. However, this game was made by Obsidian using Bethesda's toolset within 18 months and blew people away so much that later on Bethesda wanted to keep development of Fallout to themselves. Much can be taken away from that.

What I think is hilarious is that people who loves Fallout 4/Fallout 76 trash on this game based on its jankiness (still present in the other games) and the lack of modernity in it, however the story is top-tier and the immersion you get is overwhelming in comparison to the other Fallout, which severely lacked of it. The fact that that's the only few things they can belittle about the game since its OLD makes this game still stand that it is the best Fallout. Sure, if you dislike old games because of graphics and rather consume bad plot in favor of high-end graphics and sprint button, then go ahead and play the recent Fallout games, but if you're wanting to capture an authentic Fallout experience LIKE THE SHOW and go about doing your own thing and have MULTIPLE ENDINGS based on YOUR ACTIONS, then this game is peak.

Remember, just because the game is old doesn't mean the game is bad. I've noticed that most FO4 lovers are old COD fans that are gushing about the graphics and the ""ting! I did a thing"" syndrome in their heads. The bugs present in the game are the same amount of bugs present in every other Fallout games, minus the crashes (which, ironically enough, NEVER happened to me during my 3rd playthrough on my Steam Deck/PC).

**[i]NOTE:[/i] Played through Fallout 3 first, then New Vegas with the TTW mod. Not sure why anyone would want to play without it. The improvements it makes and the ease of installation prevents the game from aging as badly as I know it would in its vanilla configuration. Amazing mod overhaul (it makes Fallout 3 playable).

Notes aside, I can see why this game stands out as one of, if not the best Fallout games of all time. The factions, characters, writing, and overall world building is better than Fallout 3 by a decent bit, and leagues ahead of Fallout 4. All DLCs are top notch. As someone who speeds through games to see everything there is to see once, its rare a game slows me down and makes me get immersed and take my time through quests and exploration. 

It maintains the proper wasteland feel from Fallout 3, but adds meaningful civilization and environmental storytelling on top of all that. Original storylines and unique locations really show you what you are missing out on when it comes to modern games. 

Combat is punchy and brutal, and the weapons are very satisfying. Perks are fun. They do a good job of putting you in situations where the combat is less about the challenge and more about the immersive experience. You really do feel like a cowboy, or raider, or lone wanderer. Whatever you get up to, the game feels like it wants to let you do it. A true RPG experience that you dont see too often anymore. 

Came for the popularity among the game's fanbase, stayed for the world, experience, and atmosphere. Every time something got repetitive, an interesting situation occurred that was unique and special to this game. I gave Fallout 3 a 6.5/10, and this game definitely improves on many of its faults.

""Fallout: New Vegas"" is set in a post-apocalyptic world where society has collapsed due to nuclear war. The game takes place in the Mojave Wasteland, a region in the former state of Nevada. Players take on the role of the ""Courier,"" a person left for dead after being shot and robbed of a mysterious package they were delivering.

The game begins with the Courier being rescued and embarking on a quest for revenge and answers about their assailants and the package they were carrying. Along the way, players encounter various factions vying for control of the Mojave, including the New California Republic (NCR), Caesar's Legion, and the enigmatic Mr. House. The choices players make throughout the game influence which factions they align with and ultimately shape the outcome of the story.

""Fallout: New Vegas"" combines elements of role-playing games with open-world exploration and tactical combat. Players can customize their character's skills, attributes, and appearance, as well as interact with a diverse cast of characters, complete quests, and engage in morally ambiguous decisions that have far-reaching consequences. The game is known for its deep narrative, dark humor, and multiple endings, providing players with a high level of replayability.",1717894478,1718077702,True,2,0,0.5483871102333068,0,False,False,False,False,22380,20250114_132026,positive,100

luckily, the game has been modded to hell, and you can grab mods that fix just about every gameplay issue you can think of.

Released in 2010 by Obsidian Entertainment, ""Fallout: New Vegas"" is a stellar addition to the Fallout series, blending a rich narrative, expansive open-world exploration, and deep role-playing elements. Set in the post-apocalyptic Mojave Wasteland, the game showcases the fallout of nuclear devastation and the struggle for power and survival.

Story and Narrative (5/5):
The narrative of ""Fallout: New Vegas"" is a standout feature. The intricate storytelling, filled with morally ambiguous choices and branching paths, puts players at the center of a conflict between various factions vying for control of the New Vegas Strip. The Courier's journey is layered with political intrigue, personal vendettas, and the quest for identity. The narrative's depth and player agency make it one of the best in the Fallout series.

Open-World Exploration (4.5/5):
The Mojave Wasteland is a vast and diverse landscape, teeming with hidden stories, unique locations, and mutated creatures. The game's open-world design encourages exploration, rewarding players with captivating side quests, memorable characters, and valuable loot. While some areas may lack the visual polish of more recent titles, the sheer scale and variety of the wasteland contribute to a compelling and immersive experience.

Role-Playing and Choices (5/5):
""Fallout: New Vegas"" excels in offering true role-playing freedom. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, dialogue choices, and faction allegiances allow players to shape their character and influence the game world. The consequences of decisions are meaningful and resonate throughout the narrative, fostering a sense of agency and consequence rarely seen in open-world RPGs.

Character Development (4.5/5):
The game's character development is robust, with a wide range of skills, perks, and playstyles to choose from. The ability to ally with different factions and companions adds depth to the gameplay, allowing for diverse approaches to challenges. The leveling system provides a satisfying sense of progression, reinforcing the player's unique role in the Mojave.

Visuals and Atmosphere (4/5):
While the graphics may show signs of aging, the art direction and attention to detail in the Mojave Wasteland create a distinctive atmosphere. The desolate beauty of the landscape, coupled with the iconic retro-futuristic aesthetics, immerses players in the Fallout universe. Mods are available to enhance the visuals for those seeking a more polished look.

Combat and Mechanics (4/5):
The combat system retains the Fallout series' signature V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System), allowing players to target specific body parts. The strategic depth of combat, combined with a wide array of weapons and customizable equipment, offers engaging encounters. However, the shooting mechanics might feel somewhat clunky compared to more modern titles.

Sound Design (5/5):
The game's sound design is outstanding, from the iconic ambient music to the atmospheric sound effects. The voice acting is top-notch, with a diverse cast of characters bringing the Mojave to life. The soundtrack, featuring tracks like ""Blue Moon"" and ""Big Iron,"" enhances the overall immersion.

Conclusion (4.7/5):
""Fallout: New Vegas"" stands as a triumph in the Fallout series, offering a narrative masterpiece, unparalleled player agency, and an immersive post-apocalyptic world. Its timeless storytelling, deep role-playing elements, and memorable characters make it a classic that continues to resonate with fans. Despite some aging visuals and technical quirks, the Mojave Wasteland remains a must-visit destination for any RPG enthusiast.

I tried my hardest to keep an open mind, to support and enjoy it, and consider the rough development timeline it has suffered. However, ultimately, despite being good enough as an RPG, Veilguard is NOT a good Dragon Age game.

[b] The positives: [/b]
The locations are visually impressive and (despite its flaws) the combat/gameplay mechanics is much more sure of itself than Inquisition or DA2, for example. The level design was overall quite engaging and some of the bigger quests, particularly the [spoiler] Siege of Weisshaupt [/spoiler] were very good.

There are however, many things that I could not look past.

1) [b] The dialogue wheel[/b]. I knew this was going to be RP-lite as soon as I saw it, however this somehow manages to be worse than it was in Inquisition. In the end I felt like it didn't matter what option I picked, because Rook never said anything remotely close to what the prompt hinted at. Every time my character spoke it felt like I had zero control over who I wanted them to be.

2) [b] Dialogue[/b]. Dialogue has been one of the main community-wide criticisms I have seen for this game and I have to say I agree. Voice actors sound like they've had no context for the conversation. Their intonation makes no sense and it constantly breaks my immersion. The banter has no soul and everyone speaks to each other like they're trying to make small-talk at a workplace. Rook never engages on a natural level with the companions; in fact they end up sounding like some sort of life coach. Everything feels like a guided therapy session. Example: Rook walks in on two companions arguing about their differences, Rook comes in and patronisingly explains the concept of Compromise, the companions shake hands and are now best friends. Rinse and repeat. It is like reading a children's storybook. This is becomes even more evident when the dialogue has to CONSTANTLY recap/explain what's going on as if it wasn't painfully obvious to begin with. Again, this is executed in a very unnatural way. It treats the player as if they are a child. This would be great in a childrens' game but this is supposedly M-rated.

3) [b] Combat[/b]. Although the combat itself is an improvement, the skill tree is tremendously flawed. It works for the early levels - you gain new skills and get to experiment with your build. However, once you reach your specialisation, that is where the fun ends. Everything is repetitive from thereon in, and every level up feels like a chore because all you are doing is grabbing new passives to keep up with the enemies. There are no new skills to look forward to. No ""endgame build"" to work towards.

4) [b] Pacing[/b]. The main quest is a solid RPG story, but I find the way it paces itself around the side-content to be a let down. There are huge end-game consequences if you don't complete the side-content. This causes the game to become a huge grind in Act 2, and lightning-speed in Act 3. I found myself getting very demotivated during Act 2, to the point where I almost lost interest completely. Then Act 3 flew by in the space of half an evening.

5) [b] Races and factions[/b]. Veilguard factions do not have the same amount of content. Picking Lords of Fortune, for example, you will get almost no tie-in content or dialogue reactivity beyond constantly saying ""for gold and glory"" over and over. The balance of faction-themed items is completely off - it actually made me wonder if they ran out of time for some of them. Races are also very inconsistent in terms of lore, making it even more difficult to RP. For example, picking an elf means your Rook constantly contradicts themselves when talking about whether they're Dalish or not, their tattoos, whether they believed in the Creators or not. It all feels completely meaningless. You have no real control over who your Rook is or what their values are.

6) [b] Black and white morality[/b]. One thing that I found compelling in previous instalments was the deep complexities of different factions. Are Templars good or bad? Should mages be imprisoned? In this game, no real debate is presented. The player factions are generally portrayed as ""the good guys"" despite them historically having dark sides to explore. Given that there is already no room for RP, we now can't even form our own judgement on complex lore-related issues. It is all stripped down to ""we must unite together and fight the bad guys"". Again, this feels childish and over-simplified.

7) [b] The worldstate[/b]. Personally, I found it a huge shame that we could not pick at least some core decisions we made in previous games. Inquisition is not my favourite, but the reason I replayed it was because I felt like my choices mattered. I enjoyed playing around with the world I had built. With Veilguard, the choices we pick only really relate to Solas. For example, my Inquisitor never mentioned his LI, but if you romanced Solas, you get (as usual) tons of content. The politics of southern Thedas is reduced to ""the Inquisitor"" and ""everything is destroyed by the Blight"". This feels incredibly lazy and was a huge let down. I used to feel excited to read codex entries referencing things from previous games, but in this game it feels completely devoid of any respect to fans who have propped up this franchise for a decade and a half.

[b] Overall[/b] I enjoyed this game while it lasted, but I doubt I will be replaying it again. For me, it goes onto the shelf with all of the other mid RPGs I have played. It will not be remembered fondly as a true Dragon Age game.",1732541348,1732541594,False,7384,52,0.9434967041015624,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

DA Veilguard took everything that made the Dragon Age series so interesting and fascinating - the conflict, the moral greyness, the choices that have consequences, the romances, the interactions with companions - and, well, deleted them. 

Yes, you have companions and there are interactions with them, but you can never interact with them by yourself (no going to talk to someone like in DAI). The romances are minimal, there's extremely little content.
The Player Character is a hand-for-hire without any personal stakes in what is happening. There is no real roleplaying aspect - you can be nice, nice-with-a-joke or stern-nice. You can never disagree with someone or tell them they're wrong. And: you have a companion from your faction that is ALWAYS more important than you for that faction. Your character doesn't really matter to the story.

But most importantly, the story has been filed down to absolute shallowness. It’s pumped so full of flavour without substance, all edges have been smoothed over until there’s nothing left of conflict and friction and ANYTHING that could be a tiny bit controversial that it feels… hollow. There are factions that are utterly useless and have zero content, and others that SHOULD have content are ignored (Lords of Fortune vs. Dwarves. Seriously. KAL-SHIROK?! Why wasn't that a faction?!?). There are such interesting story bits in side quests and companion quests, but none have consequences, none have depth (looking at dwarven magic, a Forgotten One, rogue Qunari, a demon possession, political upheaval in Tevinter...). 

Nothing from the old games matters. The more lore you know, the harder it is to play this game. They completely erase Thedas from the map in LETTERS your character may or may not read. Finally we see Tevinter - except we see nothing of Tevinter or even hints of what we know of the land. No slavery, no blood magic - except for the faceless bad Venatori, of course. Finally we see the Crows - except we see nothing of what Zevran fought against and tried to dismantle. Instead we have a benevolent mafia (???). Finally, we see Dalish that are actually adept at handling their story - and then they kick that around with a conversation where they speculate that maybe humans were right to treat them like they did.

There's more, but this is long already. The game is visually beautiful and the lore we get of Solas and Mythal etc. is awesome. The fights are fun (if you don't mind that the same enemies respawn every time you walk around a corner). But if you're looking for an RPG, Veilguard is not the game for you. If you're looking to deepen you experience of Dragon Age, Veilguard is not the game for you. I really wanted to love this game. Instead, I'm so massively annoyed and disappointed by it I won't be replaying it.",1733951378,1733951640,False,3370,43,0.943204879760742,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

I went back and played the other two games multiple times, read the lore and additional comics, made several world states in the Dragon Age keep, carefully and thoughtfully building my ideal story so that when Dreadwolf finally came and I could lead my beloved characters and this full, beautiful world into a finale worthy of it. You can imagine my disappointment.

Dragon Age: Veilguard feels like a game catered to a different audience entirely. I still cannot believe it belongs to the same game series and world I fell in love with. To put it into perspective, Dragon Age: Inquisition ends on a cliffhanger that suggests a cultural revolution and uprising from the elves leaving to join forces with Solas and his armies. It leaves both the sunburst and andrastian chantry shocked, horrified and angry at Solas' claims to disprove their entire religion and taking up arms for it. Tevinter, at the heart of it all, losing control of both their religious following in the crisis of faith and the elves they've enslaved, all with the Qunari knocking harder on their doorstep. The Inquisition is left either a powerful but corrupt organization with a massive army and no direction, or a small group of friends with few resources and weak efforts; all this in addition to the storyline that followed us through every game before this, the Circle mages finally rebelling against the Templars, causing tensions to be higher than they've ever been on a scale much bigger than Kirkwall in Dragon age 2 and sending the chantry into more discord, leaving the divine you've chosen to frantically pick up the pieces. This was our setup into this game.

I was on the edge of my seat, particularly with the state of the world now, thinking at least I can fight my battles in Dragon Age and tackle this representation of very real issues to help me process the horrors we are seeing politically today. I don't know how to express how much this game meant to me, and so to play through it and discover that all of the lore and relevance and meaning that I had been anticipating not only wasn't there, but was actively dismissed the moment they asked me to set minimize my entire world state into 2 of maybe the least important questions (I love solas don't get me wrong but holy shit there was so much more) : whether or not the inquisition was disbanded (not even for story purposes around corruption or anything like the reasons said in the third game, but simply for a single sentence the inquisitor says) and whether or not I wanted to redeem Solas.

I couldn't believe the disrespect for the long term fans of the game in the interest of a much simpler and bland setting full of characters with two or three personality traits each, poorly written and frankly jarring dialogue choices, the loss of tactical camera for a more trendy and oversimplified combat and loot system (though I will admit this is more personal preference and the pacing of the combat system was actually an improvement in some ways despite being a disappointment in others), and the loss of such impactful, empathetic, captivating and personal relationships reduced to a handful of romantic encounters and surface-level problems that not only are severely lacking in content and perspective but feel reminiscent of scrambling to get teenagers to work together for their last minute dnd game.

And, on an even more personal note, I feel personally scorned as a trans person playing this game. I was at first delighted to discover that my community would have representation and the option to be trans and have a variety of LGBTQ+ representation in the game to look forward to. What I did not expect was to see a childish brat who quite literally spits in their mother's face for not understanding them immediately, undermining all the effort and pain that many queer people endure to keep their families and help them understand their queerness. Taash has no respect or empathy for others, and their arguments for queerness feel like watching the plot of heartstopper catered at pre-teens suddenly thrust in the middle of a 15 year old dark fantasy franchise. Taash is a disrespectful and harmful interpretation of a very lovely and important community that has only given grounds for conservative bigots to hate on our community more. It is a gross oversimplification of queer struggles, and frankly I have no idea why they couldn't just give us representation without having to attend a therapy session between what is supposed to be a grown person and their mother that we cannot even express our disapproval or discomfort with in the game. It makes me sad to think back on that beautiful scene with Dorian and his father in Inquisition, where the word gay isn't even mentioned or really relevant, it's just a fact of his reality and his reconciliation with his father is something all people, not just the queer community could relate to. It was a storyline that honored the existence and difficulties of queerness while acknowledging that although it is relevant and does matter, who the fuck cares, and how is it your business? Knowing that Bioware had done and could have done it right again instead of what we got broke my heart.

I understand that there is a lot of pressure, time, money, and work to come out with a game founded on such tangled webs and what if's depending on whether or not the player experienced the previous games, but I firmly believe that Veilguard could have set itself up for success with a short animated sequence in game to catch players up and let them choose their world state right there; if they had prioritized the love and respect of the world and its art over fitting into current trends, I can now only imagine what could have been--I would have taken so much over what we got, but alas.

I have so much more to say and so many grievences to air, but these are the ones I felt were most important to share and hopefully will save someone $60.

TLDR: if you are a long term fan of the Dragon Age franchise and love the lore, I would not recommend this game, and I instead would encourage you to save yourself the time and money, and go back and play the games we know and love.

If you're new here, and you just want a simple RPG, I still wouldn't recommend it, because it's $60 and 70 hours minimum for a whole lot of ""meh"". I personally recommend The Witcher, Baldurs Gate 3, or Vampyr if you're looking for an interesting RPG.",1733523808,1733534260,False,1978,30,0.9132230281829832,31,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

The good:
Runs very well, very smooth, not a single bug or stutter in 12 hours of gameplay.
The visual design of the levels and environments and the atmosphere of the big set pieces. They look and feel big and apocalyptic.
Character creation, visually has alot of options and room to make your PC look the way you want. Hair in particular looks very lifelike.

The bad:
The Combat - Is mediocre at best, whilst the visuals and animations are quite flashy, it feels like a dumbed down version of Inquisitions combat. It gets boring and repetitive within a few hours. I turned the difficulty down after a few hours so I could get through it more quickly. Gone is the tactical combat and engineered party synergy of previous games.

The Story - Feels like it has the skeleton of compelling, intriguing narrative full of secrets revlealed, moral ambiguity and challenging decisions. However it's like it's been simplified to the level of a child's cartoon or a by the numbers phase 4 Marvel movie. This get's so frustrating because there are so many points that have the glimmer of a truly great and compelling RPG, but at every turn it feels like they fall short and fail to realise that potential. The DA setting has been built up as such well realised world with a compelling history full of mystery. Veilguard reveals answers alot of those mysteries but how they do it cheapens and taints everything that came before.

The Gear - Reminds me of a bad Korean MMO. Combine duplicate gear to upgrade it and give it more stats? Really? Where's the going on an epic quest to find a legendary sword etc? The immersion and investment?

The Worst:
The Characters & Dialogue - This is what I expect to be the high point of a Bioware game. So many times they have created compelling, well drawn casts of characters that form a web of friendship, rivalry, romance etc that I couldnt help but get entangled in. In this Veilguard fails completely. Many of the characters have alot of potential and interesting concepts, but it's rolled flat by childish, wooden dialogue. Solas is the only character that is interesting at all and much of that I suspect is just because of the build up of the previous game. This is the biggest disappointment, the game totally failed to make me invested in any of the characters in any way. The might as well have been characters in a commercial.

Conclusion:
As a fan of the series this is a huge disappointment. Ever since finishing Inquisition I've looked forward to this game yet now I've had to stop playing around 13 hours in because the game has just become a tiresome chore. Given that I replayed each of the previous installments multiple times (even DA2!). Worse this actively taints the previous games, knowing where all the tension and mystery they build is headed.

If you are expecting a Role Playing Game where your decisions can influence the story, this is not it. This is a linear action game in the Dragon Age universe. I have nothing against action games, I actually enjoy them very much but that is not what this game was marketed as.

Combat is fun. As a spellblade mage I enjoyed the gameplay quite a bit. Enemy variation gets a little stale by the end of the game though.

Companions in the game are inconsequential. I enjoyed some of the companions' stories but some of them were just a grind to finish their quest line. They are highlighted buttons to press in the combat. Dialogue is sometimes fun, sometimes torture. 

I see no replay value since the choices don't really change the story significantly, other than the choice at the end of the game.

You can tell that this was a live service game at one point. The combat and abilities feel very MMO-like, and they have a floaty-ness that feels unsatisfying. A lot of my other opinions are spoilers, so I'll leave those on the table...Fans of Origins are going to be frustrated, though.

Original Review:

It's...fine. Just fine. I'm going to get into some spoilers for Inquisition in this review, and some very minor spoilers for the first hour or so of Veilguard. You've been warned.

Look, I'm a software engineer myself. When I play this game, I can tell that the team behind it worked WONDERS behind the scenes. This is one of the single most stable AAA games released in years -- It's definitely way more stable than Inquisition was when it was released. I've yet to encounter any serious bugs. The frame pacing is stellar. Even with Ultra Ray Tracing enabled, the game just RUNS. It's a technical marvel what they've been able to do with Frostbite -- an engine that used to have a reputation for being impossible to work with if you weren't making a Battlefield game. On a technical level, this product is really something to be proud of. 

But we don't come to Dragon Age for its technical prowess, do we? I haven't played much yet, so I'm going to give this game a chance. If by the end of the game it manages to change my mind, I'll come up and update this review. But, ultimately, this game has fumbled the story on a fundamental level, and I think most Dragon Age fans are going to come away frustrated.

Your character comes out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. That gameplay demo that they showed off a couple months back? That is the start of the game. Nothing happens before you. You're already buddies with Varric. You're already on board with the core conflict of the game. The game makes no effort to set up any reason that YOU, Rook, specifically have an investment in this conflict beyond ""Saving The World."" 

In Inquisition, and Dragon Age: Origins, you were an unwilling participant in the events that make you a hero. In Origins, you were living a mostly happy life until something goes horribly wrong, and you're forced to run away with the Gray Wardens. Then they all die, and you're left the only person left who can save the world.

In Inquisition, you were an attendee at a summit between the Chantry and Mages that was trying to resolve the conflict of Dragon Age 2 (Which I'm leaving out of this discussion because its status among the community is...complicated). The summit is blown to pieces, and you're left with a rift to the veil on your hand as tears begin to open up all over the world. You're the only person with the ability to close these rifts, and so you have to step up and do something. And even if you weren't the only one, you have the mystery of what happened to you as a driving factor.

In Veilguard? Well, you're just kind of there. Presumably Varric dug you out of a gutter somewhere, started doing some missions with you, and by the time the game starts you are somehow aware of everything that's going on and are fully on board with your role in stopping it all. 

And...That's BAFFLING to me. Dragon Age isn't like Mass Effect. They've never carried over the protagonist between games, but to account for that, they ensured that the core conflict of each game was uniquely yours. You were living out a new chapter in the history of Thedas. Your decisions in previous games helped set the stage for you, but you had your OWN motivations for doing what you were doing.

In the Veilguard, the conflict isn't Rook's. It's the Inquisitor's. Solas was one of the inquisitor's closest friends and confidants, and he went on an entire globe-spanning adventure with them in order to save the world. Then, after you've done so...you realize that he was behind everything all along. He was secretly an immortal god of the Elves that created the veil to seal away his fellow gods, tearing magic out of the world and rendering everyone -- and most notably his fellow Elves -- mortal. Thousands of years later, he regrets what he has done and wants to unsever the world and return it to the wonderous state it was in before. He fumbles that at first, and the villain of the main game gets ahold of the MacGuffin that he was going to use to do that...But when you stop him, Solas is now free to pursue other avenues to achieve his goals -- at the cost of countless lives. But he hadn't counted on coming to know you. In finding your companionship.

In the closing act of Inquisition, you are left helplessly confronting Solas as he lays out everything that he is planning, and then he leaves you there to sit with that betrayal. If you are an elf woman, and you romanced Solas, the scene is particularly powerful -- You realize at the same time that Solas is the god that your people abhor, and the person that set in motion the events that set your life ablaze. But you still love him. And you beg him to listen to you, and find another way. But then he leaves. And you swear to follow.

----

And then you don't. Some new smuck does. Bioware has made the decision to continue the conflict from Inquisition, with all of the emotional baggage that comes with it, but they remove all of the people that were involved in that conflict and have something to say about it aside from a handful of returning characters that seem pretty minor so far. This random new smuck is the one confronting Solas for what he did. This random new smuck is the one to chase him down and stop him. And it feels extremely hollow. The story that they are trying to tell is BEGGING for the Inquisitor to be the main character. And I think the developers realize that. In the first 10 minutes of the game, when you confront Solas for the first time...YOU don't do anything, Varric does. Why? Because, however tenuous, Varric has SOME history with Solas, and you have none. You can't confront him because none of that pain is yours...And honestly, not much of it is Varric's either. This game is BEGGING for the Inquisitor to be the one standing there, trying to talk him down.

But for whatever reason, they shot themselves in the foot and made what could have been an incredibly powerful story incredibly hollow by having some random unknown be the person to tie off those threads. Hell, even if they didn't want to bring the Inquistor back, they could have at least spent SOME TIME setting up your character's motivations for being there. Maybe Solas' plans intersect with your life in some way, and now you're the next unwilling participant in your own Dragon Age adventure. But they didn't even do that much. You're some dude that Varric scooped up off the street and set to work solving his problems...And you don't even get to see that much. You're just there. You have a mission. You're a badass. You may have never met him, but you sure do know that this Solas guy needs to be stopped.

I've only played the intro so far, but I felt so incredibly burned by how they decided to set up this game that I feel like it's going to color my thoughts about it going forward. They needed to:

A. Make Solas tangential to the adventure, and give your character his own inciting incident and role in this world.

OR 

B. Make this game a direct sequel to Inquisition, and the Inquisitor the main character.

Instead they tried to mash together a little from column A and column B, and made something that is SO far all around disappointing.

Veilguard almost feels afraid to mention any of the past games in a meaningful way, Characters like Morrigan and Harding who return don't feel or look like themselves, Harding in particular feeling 10 years younger than herself in Inquisition, returning characters can only mention past games in a vague way, you can't ask any of these characters any thing worthwhile.  BioWare throws away one of their more interesting villains in Solas in the first 10 minutes of the game just to be replaced by 2 generically and cartoonishly evil bad guys.

And I've judged it based on how it fits with the rest of the games in the series. 

Dragon Age series has never been afraid of delving into heavier topics such as racism, slavery or sexual violence. Veilguard, on the other hand, seems to have sanded down all heavier topics from the lore or has thrown them away entirely. It has done a disservice to the lore and fans of the lore.

No longer does it feel like your choice of race matters that much. Sure you get unique dialog but outside of that, no one really reacts to it. You don't get the sense that you're in a world where Elves are almost entirely servants or slaves (only ones not are the nomadic dalish), where they lost nearly all their own culture through years of forced assimilation. Or where Qunari have been at war with Tevinter for hundreds of years, as if people forget the atrocities of war that quickly and let a random qunari just waltz about wherever they please.

The game seems to take a very black and white approach of ""good guys must be good, bad guys must be bad"". They took a notorious assassin group and made them into glorified freedom fighters, who've never killed innocent people (despite being, you know, ASSASSINS). The treasure hunters apparently have experts on relics to tell them when something is culturally important so they can return it. Just so there's 0 chance of them being seen as problematic. The villains in this game are cartoonish. What's worse, they make their army out of people who, realistically, wouldn't be that happy to follow them. The only justification they give for this is ""power hungry people follow those who promise them power :)"", ignoring any nuance there would normally be for these decisions. Let's not forget the two groups who join the villains have notoriously been at war with each other until recently. And all of a sudden they're besties?

I went into this game with an open mind, hoping they'd prove my apprehensions wrong. But they didn't. It's not just the lore they butchered either. It's how it treats you, the player, as well. Companions summarise what you saw only seconds ago, so you wouldn't possibly make your own interpretations. It tells you exactly how to solve each puzzle you come across, at least in the story and companion missions (don't remember if it also happened in free exploration). It felt like the devs were treating me like a child, or like I was stupid. It felt even worse to get to the end and only get a summary of the game you just played in the ending slides (where in previous games you found out what happened to companions and such after the game, where they went etc). And then I saw the secret ending.  They just couldn't leave some of the villains of the previous 3 games be and just HAD to take away or diminish their agency.

Its obvious to see the writers have no life experience to draw from since much of the story feels as if it was generated by an AI.

The world is falling apart around you and everyone is unbearably nice about it. Should you choose the ""evil"" option on the dialogue wheel (which is just pragmatism), characters will go as far as to apologise on your behalf should you be too mean.

 There is no sense of urgency in the world and the first major choice in the game came at completely the wrong time. It's impossible to spoil the story, as its terrible, but you are given a choice, between companions and cities. Which one will you help? However the writers, voice artists or world building made no effort to create any attachments to one or the other. Enough to make you hover over the uninstall button and wish you got this game on EA Play. 

You are in a fantasy world that is open for you to explore. However the developers decided to use only exposition after exposition after more exposition to explain this world to you. Between this exposition dialogue you and your companions will constantly pat each other on the back and lie to each other about how awesome the other is. 

Class choices are boring and the abilities of your companions makes you miss the older games that allowed you to control them directly. For instance I wanted a griffon and the abilities it came with but I am forced to drag around a boring character if I want to access that. Companions are only good for their combo abilities. They will often disengage targets or the enemies they do target will still attack you.

When senior writer David Gaider left Bioware he said Bioware no longer cared about writing quality, and man was he right. This game is embarrassingly poorly written in every way. The dialog is the worst millennial snark, the tone is Saturday morning cartoon shenannigans, the depth and maturity in the previous games has been completely stripped out. This game's writing is so afraid to challenge anyone, to make anyone think, to offend anyone, to have anyone take it seriously, that it ends up childish and boring.

The game's original muiltiplayer design is also all over it. All real dialog comes from quest steps, there's no real wandering around town talking to people. Levels feel like linear loot grind missions. Companions rarely chime in during dialog or appear in cutscenes unless it's specifically their companion quest. Even the kid's show tone is likely rooted in this desire to be an online game played by a billion Fortnite kids.

Why did I play it so long? Well the combat is actually really good! Making character builds with a plethora of choices and combinations of skills, gear and tactics is great stuff. That's what I spent most of my time doing, and I had fun doing it. I also wanted to see how the story of this franchise (likely) ended, despite the awful writing.

However from any kind of objective point of view this game is not that good. It's not good as a story whatsoever, it's not good as an RPG because of obvious limitations of multiplayer design, and it's not good as a Dragon Age sequel because of gameplay changes and childish storytelling.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a disappointment to me on so many levels. 

As a fan of Dragon Age playing from Origins, I am used to a game which allowed me to choose how I wanted to play it. It also made my choices impactful, with repercussions of choices showing meaning later in my adventure, even spanning to later titles in the franchise. Dragon Age: The Veilguard threw all of that away, making a grand total of only TWO choices from previous games that mattered. Not to mention that almost all of the dialogue has no impact on how the game plays out, and you can almost just close your eyes to pick what your character says, and the outcome would be the same.

The original Dragon Age series gave me choice, letting me adventure with the companions I liked, throw away the ones I did not, and never forced me to sit through tedious and absolutely HAIR RIPPING scenarios of side quests of characters I did not like. Veilguard makes you keep every single companion, forces you to see them in quests you don’t even bring them along to, and even worse, implores you multiple times to make sure to do the OPTIONAL side companion questlines for every companion, or your party will not be strong enough to face the final battle.

[spoiler]The game does let you influence how the ending plays out. Too bad that you must complete EVERY COMPANION QUEST in order to change the game's ending from “bad” to “good”. So even if you skip ONE companion quest of a character, you will not get a good ending. I am literally telling you that if you have a character that you do not like and skip their OPTIONAL quest, you will get a bad ending. For an RPG game that lets you kick out, and even lets you sell one of your companions to slavery in past games, I find it absolutely ridiculous to lock a good ending behind optional companion quests. Despite the constant backseating and babying from this game to complete the companion sidequests, I kid you not, even at the end it told me “with greater preparation and time spent with companions and allies, the Veilguard might have survived”. My soul left my body at this moment, it was infuriating. [/spoiler]

The combat seems to be a step up from Inquisition, and was fun at first. After my third session it became extremely unbearable and super repetitive. I can’t even bring myself to write one redeeming quality of this game in detail.

This game forces me to be the therapist of a cast of characters that are unlikeable adult babies who feel like they came from a Disney movie in the worst way possible. It makes me sit and listen to these people whine about their issues, while the world is actually ending. Even the cameos of characters from previous games are bad. They feel like cheap party tricks that have no real meaning. BioWare messed up the art direction so bad, that the character cameos are almost comically unrecognizable. I hate everyone here, I hate myself, I hate this game. 

I have been waiting 10 years for a game that was a disappointment, and lowers my opinion of the franchise itself and definitely the current state of BioWare.

Achieved nearly all the achievements for it and got the ending I was hoping to get. I am greatly disappointed in this game. I cannot believe my beloved Dragon Age franchise did this as their grand finale. This game really tried to destroy much loved memories I had from previous titles. There were moments that shinned and at times I thought that there was hope for the game, especially early on. But then the blight really destroyed BioWares mind. Spoilers Below:

Character Customisation:
POSITIVE: Great hair physics and nice to see lighting used to make sure your character looks great.

NEGATIVE: As someone who enjoys as much freedom to customise your character and appreciating all the extra details, I felt so under represented with the customisation features. I like my characters being a more curvy figure to my own and I love seeing how clothing in fantasy worlds fit this aesthetic. The fact that my chest can only be a B cup is highly inappropriate and non inclusive for a game that prides itself on inclusivity. If you are going to make it fair, make customisation for everyone. The Sims even does it better.

Environment:
POSITIVE: I was well crafted and every area was interesting and told the story of the location.

NEGATIVE: None.


Combat:
POSITIVE: The combat was excellent. I actually tired each style of class before settling on a mage. The smooth movement mixed with the wide array of spells and play styles was fantastic. All the directional icons where a bit much but you can customise that which helped with engaging more in combat. The combination work of your team to weaken or detonate an enemy brought a great element of fun and suspense in some more trying fights.

NEGATIVE: I swear I have never fought so many dragons in my life. I was expecting these to be rare and a really big challenge but I finished all of them early on as their move style was exactly the same. Quite disappointing when an Ogre was tougher than a Dragon. 

Story:
POSITIVE: It was nice to see so many familiar faces... 

NEGATIVE: Where do I even begin. It is terrible. I couldn't even write something this bad. There is no drive with this team, there is no choice. It is a friendship simulator disguised at a Dragon Age game. I wanted to try some evil options, I wanted choices that made an actual difference and I wanted to convince or make enemies of other, choose my companions and piss off the companions I didn't like. I couldn't stand half of my team and the ones I did like were tolerable only because of how cool they could have been. There are lore elements in here that are inconsistent to other games and character morals that we have witnessed in other games complete ruined by incompetent writing. I almost punched my monitor when Morrigan started telling me her 'changed' outlook on life and her 'new' story (PS: WHERE IS HER SON?). Everything I loved in the prior games was destroyed by terrible writing and all they had to do to fix it was not force us to hate Solas (Leave Solas Alone :P). If you love Dragon Age lore and the story so far, just skip this. 

Romance:
POSITIVE: At least there was romance in this game.

NEGATIVE: I don't think the writers know what romance and suspense is. They nailed it in the other games. You build up admiration with another character through flirting (some of that was so badly written in DAV that I didn't believe it was even flirting), to then have a moment of confession (which usually happened on a date or during a fight), then there is 'passion' (secret meetings, snog sessions and more dates) and then a sweeping kiss or intimate scene before a big fight and finally an 'I love you' before a final fight. THIS GAME, it was flirt with everyone then confession (I romanced Lucanis and my confession was over him cooking me food - no actual confirmation of a confession) then sleep together... no 'I like you', first kiss, date or anything like that. There was no suspense and when they FINALLY hinted at a kiss it just ended and NEVER happened again. My first kiss with the person I was in a relationship with in game was just before the only intimate scene in game. The 'I love you' meant nothing as I felt like Rook was taken advantage of.

SOLAS:
My final comment is in regards to Solas. I romanced him when I first played DAI. I loved his story, I liked how he almost fell to the Inquisitor and in the DLC I was so excited to see what he would do. The fact that this game was trying to force me to hate him, loath him and even kill him made me angry. It was as if everything we learnt about him in DAI was ignored and he was just another elven god trying to destroy the world. There is even a moment in game where Rook states that she must kill Solas before killing the last boss. I sat there going 'Hes got the same goal as you, why the hell would you do that. Use him then decide what to do.' I, as a player, shouldn't be thinking that. If you play this game without any love for Solas it would be an easy story to tell. But man the writers tried hard to convince you otherwise and contradicted themselves while trying to do it. 

CONCLUSION:
DAV was a game I am glad I played. But I wish it was the game it should of been. I finished it to finish the story of Solas. But my score went from a hopeful 7/10 at the start when I saw glimpses of potential that I was so desperate for. To finish the game with a 3/10.

The main character, rook, is deeply frustrating to play as and cannot help but insert a quip or say 'im sorry' in every conversation; there is no role play in this RPG you will play as Rook and you will like it.  The companions all have a inherit personality trait, which is an interesting concept to make them unique. However, these traits are the ONLY thing that is apparent about them, the ADHD one is a stereotype, the gender non-conforming one constantly talks about it while not respecting other peoples identities.  Everything this game does comes off as tone deaf and immature in the dialogue department.    The overall story starts off as interesting and falls off a cliff instantly.  There is no gradual climb to power, you are fighting gods with no growth to get there.  The combat starts off amazingly fun, genuinely a great start, but the level system lacks the depth to change the playstyle, instead it mostly makes 'what you do better'.  Which is fine, but after 20-40 hours the fact im playing the same as a level 10 character is wild.

The writing is frankly terrible —cringeworthy and overly simplistic, with clichés and tropes everywhere. There’s no real sense of danger or stakes, and the dialogue feels like it was lifted from a bad parody of a Marvel movie.

The companions I’ve encountered (I think I’ve met all but one) are actively annoying, and the voice acting for one or two is just plain bad. (neve)  I dread any conversations with them because they’re so tedious.

The levels feel like the developers took all the wrong lessons from God of War: Ragnarok. Instead of borrowing the good elements—like solid storytelling and  decent characters—they copied the level design and created environments that feel artificial and repetitive. Sure, there are a couple of different biomes, but they all end up looking pretty similar and filled with random obstacles just to showcase your “powers.” Inquisition wasn’t perfect, but at least the world felt a bit more engaging to explore.

And there really is no good answer to whether or not I would recommend this game. I enjoyed the beginning and the end, but gun to my head I would have to say slogging through the tedium that is the middle of the game is not worth it. So here are my thoughts about why this is. 

Before I start, the game is not that bad on the diversity front. One companion will shove it down your throat, but the rest of the time it is pretty non intrusive. So don't let the fact that you might think the game is too DEI heavy keep you from playing it. If it really bothers you just don't do any of Taash's quests. They suck regardless so you won't miss anything worthwhile. Now on to the actual review.

First, this game doesn't care that you played the other three in the series. It is going to tell the story it wants to tell, and the choices you made in the other games don't exist. This sucks, a lot. In a series that has always reacted to your previous choices, having this one do its own thing just feels bad, and every time something happened that wouldn't have happened in the world I had created with the other games it felt annoying, and then sad. I just couldn't get nearly as invested into this story as the previous ones because of this and other reasons.

Additionally, the game thinks you are stupid. It will spell out the consequences of every decision you make immediately after you make it, and will point out every time a past decision you made influences something that is currently happening. Also, the dialogue wheel just feels dated at this point. Instead of relationships being built over the course of many decisions that characters approve of, or agonizing over a dialogue choice because you're not sure which one is the best for what you want, it's just pick the flirt option if you want to romance, and pick the other options if you don't. Outside of that there is really no difference between the other options.

Another reason I couldn't get super invested is the party members. Now don't get me wrong, I liked 5 out of 7 of them, which isn't awful, but I wasn't ready to go to war for any of them like Morrigan in Origins or Merrill in 2. They didn't feel integral to my journey, the dialogue is just boring (which is a problem throughout the game) and they don't impact your story in any meaningful way. Cut them all out and not that much changes. they just felt like they needed to be there because that's what people expect from Bioware games. All of them lacked the depth and complexity that made me love previous Bioware companions, but Neve and Taash in particular sucked. Neve because her voice actress sounded bored the entire time, and Taash because the script they wrote for her was just awful. One day they may make an interesting non-binary character, but Taash is not it. I don't know why games and shows like to make character's non-cisgender status as their whole identity, but it sucks every time, and this time it's no different.

Next, the combat system reinforced this feeling. This is the first of the many parallels I will draw to Mass Effect. In fact, the game felt much more like a Mass Effect game than a Dragon Age game. Your party members are pretty much just there to throw out powers, except now they are even more useless as they do zero damage outside of their powers. In Mass Effect at least your party members would kill things with their shots sometimes. Here they do tiny little bits of damage, and don't take any themselves. You are the main character, and you will kill everything. This is now a full fledged arpg, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I like arpgs and have played a lot of them. But the combat just doesn't feel incredible like it should in an arpg. It just felt serviceable, lacking depth, and combined with the ridiculously spongy enemies on nightmare combat eventually became a slog, so much so that towards the end I turned the difficulty all the way down so combat wouldn't take so long.

Another reason I turned down the difficulty was the story and world. It got so bogged down and slow in the middle that after 55 hours of it I was just done and wanted to finish the game. The antagonists being the most boring, we are super evil because we are super evil caricatures ever made, and the lack of an open world make the game feel like it slowed to a crawl in the middle. Missions felt more like Mass Effect missions than Dragon Age ones. You run a long a predetermined path, fighting enemies, doing stupid puzzles, and opening chests along the way. Only the reintroduction of Solas at the end, who should have been the main antagonist throughout, redeemed the ending. They pulled another Mass Effect and copied 2 with you having to choose specific companions to go do other things, like lead the other team, and the choices you make can lead to deaths or different outcomes. Even though I adore ME2, it felt super lame that I had already done this in another one of their games from over a decade ago. Although they tried to ruin it with one of the most pointless and stupid twists I have ever experienced. I just can't get over how dumb that twist was. Whoever wrote that should be banned from writing ever again. 

That said, there were some insane and awesome lore reveals that I was legitimately floored by. Make sure you do the Dread Wolf's regrets quest line if you choose to play the game. Not only do you need it for the true ending but the lore reveals in there are crazy and amazing.

My final big issue with the game is its systems. The skill tree for the mc is fine. Nothing incredible, nothing awful, and lets you craft a character how you want. The problem is the loot system does not support this. It's completely random. The upgrade system works off dupes. Gear starts common, and with each dupe you get it ranks up all the way to legendary, getting new affixes along the way. The problem with this is if you don't rng the gear your want, that build you created in the skill tree won't work because you don't have the gear to support it. 

The loot system is also terrible. Except for item dupes, all of the loot in the game feels so inconsequential. Almost all of it is junk that you sell. Opening chests just felt so lame. The fact that you will spend a good chunk of your time in the game doing insipid puzzles to open every chest, only to get more of the same junk most of the time, because if you don't you might miss an rng check for the gear dupe for the item you want just feels so lame.

To wrap up my essay, I would say that unless you are a certified Dragon Age nut like me, avoid the game. You won't appreciate the highs of the game unless you know about the world and lore of the series, and the game is not fun enough to play on its own. And even if you are a lore junkie, go in knowing the game doesn't care about the world you built in the previous games. Accept that Isabella is basically just there to lecture you about the correct way to respond when you mess up a person's pronouns we have all seen on YouTube by now. Accept that Morrigan's Old God kid no longer exists. Accept that many of the things that got you invested in the world in the first place no longer exist, and try to appreciate what is left.

[b]tldr;[/b] if you are a long-term fan STAY AWAY, don't let this game ruin your Thedas too. And if you're new here, there are better RPGs out there, this is NOT worth your money or time. Lots of ""meh""s. 

Dragon Age: Veilguard – where the franchise's legacy goes to die... If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if a Dragon Age game had all the depth of a kiddie pool, this is your answer. Sure, it’s an [i]action RPG[/i], but if you’re hoping for something even remotely close to what made Dragon Age great, prepare to be let down.

Let’s start with [u]the lore[/u]—because who doesn’t love a good betrayal? The game completely erases everything that made the Dragon Age universe interesting. Racial tensions? Gone. You can still play as elves and Qunari, but don’t worry, their history and struggle won’t be weighing you down. Slavery? Meh, doesn’t matter anymore. The deep complexities of a world where elves are oppressed and Qunari are locked in centuries of war? Apparently, those were just too complicated for this Disney game, so we’ll just toss them out the window. Pick your race, get a tiny bit of unique dialogue and move on. 

Gone are the days when [u]your decisions[/u] in previous Dragon Age games actually mattered. The impact of past choices? Sorry not here. The world of Veilguard feels so disconnected —like it’s trying to be a Dragon Age game but not really bothering to remember what came before it. Decisions you made in 1, 2 AND Inquisition —where the MAIN VILLAIN of Veilguard came from? Well, forget about them, because none of that is relevant now. The game’s world-building is just a vague outline of the Dragon Age universe with no respect for the rich history of the series.

And let’s not forget [u]the dialogue system[/u]. It’s basically a choose-your-own-adventure but none of the choices matter. You get a dialogue wheel that lets you pick responses that have absolutely nothing to do with what your character actually says. It’s a masterclass in not letting you make meaningful choices. Oh, and the voice acting? Think of it like a motivational speaker giving a TED talk—flat, lifeless, and completely lacking in emotional depth. The banter between companions? Let’s just say you’ll be begging for a little awkward silence after the 50th pep talk with toxic positivity. 

[u]The pacing[/u] is... something. Act 2 is a marathon of side content, designed to grind you down until you start questioning all your life choices. You’ll feel like you’re playing a game made by someone who’s read a book about RPGs but never actually played one. You’ll hear your companions repeat what you just saw in case your brain stopped working for five seconds. It’s as if the developers thought, [i]“What if the player is too dumb to remember what just happened? Let’s remind them every two minutes!”[/i] WE MUST DEFEAT THE ANCIENT ELVEN GODS ELGAR'NAN AND GHILAN'NAIN!!!

[u]Veilguard tries so desperately to be all things to all people, but ends up pleasing no one.[/u] It sacrifices the depth and complexity that made Dragon Age special in an attempt to be more accessible. It borrows elements from action games like God of War —but somehow doesn’t do any of them nearly as well— and hopes that’s enough to satisfy Dragon Age fans. Spoiler alert: it’s not. 

The game’s a confused mess of half-baked ideas, watered-down lore, and combat that doesn’t quite know what it wants to be. Enemies are too spongy, characters are too one dimensional, writing is horrible. I could go on and on... Maybe a small group of people will enjoy it but for anyone who has [i]any[/i] attachment to the Dragon Age franchise, this game is a sad, sad shadow of what used to be.",1734008015,1734012118,False,940,18,0.8852937817573547,18,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

I've always been a fan of Bioware games, like Mass Effect, and OG Baldur's Gate. And I replayed ALL the DA games ready and in anticipation of DAV. I am both saddened and mad at the state of this game!! 

Lets start off with the things I'm glad about:

- Romance any of the companions (honestly felt that this should have been in all the games) 
- Better hair styles
- Even on lowest graphics it looks like DAI on ultra (though that was 10 years old at this point) 
- You can pet cats and dogs you find in your travels, not all but some (edit)

Cons:

- Characters feel samey - they really don't have anything to distinguish themselves from each other, and feel very much like a click where everyone loves everyone and gets alone with no issues.
- Back to DAO days of corridor running
- Puzzles are lacking/non-existent
- Combat is dull, boring and lacks skills to use on the battlefield - by this in DAI you could have up to 8 skills on your hot bar when using controller and still be able to command your party. You get one less companion and only 3 skills this time round, making combat a ""smash x to win""
- No dalish option for your character if your run elf - this feels like a HUGE miss 
- Lack of character development for both PC and companions
- No real renegade options - I miss being able to choose if i wanted a lawful good run or just pure chaos
- approval system is just pointless 
- Lore completely retconned - Everything I knew about DA (literally replayed all 3 games so many times cos of my love for the games) was thrown out of a window and stamped on. Feels more like a 12 year old girl's fanfic than a real lore driven game. 
- Story lack luster, feels all choices I made in previous games to create a world state was pointless, and while I understand after all this time would be hard to integrate DAV in to something like DragonsKeep I feel they should have given us more choices to add in that would MATTER to the game state. Not only that the story feels stale, uninteresting and just weak. Even DA2 was better than this and we all know that had a weak story with bad pacing, this is 100% times worse!!
- I felt patronised as a player by how the characters talked down to me even Varric when that has never been his personality.
- Character assassinated previous characters from how they speak, to how they behaved.
- This is not a ""progressive"" game, the original 3 games where progressive, this felt very regressive and a lot of pointless real world politics added in a distasteful way, that it was uncomfortable for me to play through, and I'm a female, bisexual, demisexual, disabled person that is usually all for progressive games, instead this was not what I got. Instead I was forced to endure very patronising cutscenes and waste time on things that have no bareings on a world ending crisis/story line. 
- Character creation, while better than previous instalments, was still bad. No matter how hard I tried to make my lady elf look good she still felt like a man in the face. Body I couldn't care less about, as the body wasn't really an option in previous games, always the same body shape and we always had gender neutral armour on anyway so I didn't care, but the face... Good gosh that was aweful... 
- Heads of all characters STILL look too large, body proportions where all over the place and looked odd and wonky. Just over all not a fan of this more cartoon look, but I could have lived with this IF this was the only con. 

Over all this has been one of the most uncomfortable games I've played through. I was so desperate for a new DA game, that I preordered the deleux edition of this game, and was so excited for this. As I mentioned earlier in this, it really does feel like someone's fanfic, that removes everything they disliked about DA (so all of the set lore and previous story) and wrote how they felt the game should end. I wish I could defend this game but I really can't and it breaks my heart. This was meant to be a continuation of the already outlined story from the first 3 games instead this doesn't even feel like the same franchise anymore. 

I get the old DA devs didn't work on this game (they don't even work at Bioware anymore) so I expected some changes/retcons, but this... This is a terrible joke, and a F--- you to the fans. The game has 0 idea what it is telling, what it wants to be, or anything. I feel at this point the game would have been better recieved had they started from scratch with Origins and rebooted the series OR better yet, just created a whole new franchise, new story and stayed away from a beloved franchise. I am usually fine with changes in games/stories but there needs to be a reason for it, it needs to be better than what came before, even if its just testing waters and flops. But I can't sit here and defend or excuse what this mess is.

While I doubt my view will change, I still plan to finish this game to see how much else has been ruined, I will NEVER recommend this game, and I pray no one buys this game as a loud message needs to be set to companies about pulling these stunts.",1730437627,1730481700,False,6982,48,0.9224069714546204,167,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

The action combat and characters are all interesting enough to warrant a playthough.

Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game for longtime Dragon Age fans. How Bioware treats the lore and the setting is absolutely atrocious. We went from a deep and complex dark fantasy setting to a squeaky clean, ultra-generic fantasy setting. The moral ambiguity we've seen from previous Dragon Age games has been completely stripped from Veilguard. Rook and the companions are all PG-rated, corporately sanitized Boy Scouts with zero edge. All the antagonists are power hungry bullies who simply want to dominate the world. This game is rated M for Mature, but it has the complexity of a Saturday morning cartoon.

It's abundantly clear that going forward, Bioware will NEVER release another deep, complex, or thought-provoking game. It's not that Bioware CAN'T make these types of games anymore. It's that they DON'T WANT to. They don't want to present you a morally ambiguous situation where you have to make a difficult decision. They're scared that you'll make the ""wrong"" decision. They'd rather you shut off your brain and let them do the thinking for you. Bioware used to be the gold standard for single player, story-focused, character-driven RPGs.

I bought this game against my better judgement in spite of the controversies and in spite of the scathing reviews from Skill Up and Mr Matty Plays because Dragon Age is my favourite gaming series. My first 3 hours were incredible and I was so happy that the game wasn't just not terrible, but actually good! However, after those frontloaded 3 hours, the cracks started to show and those cracks quickly turned into a gaping chasm of mediocrity and I started to realise those two creators told several truths in their reviews. I strongly recommend you check at least one of those out before you buy but, after my first 11 hours, these are MY initial thoughts:

[h2] The Good: [/h2]

[b] - Character Models: [/b] The stylised art was a point of apprehension for me but it grew on me within the first hour. Character models look great. It's easy to create a stunningly beautiful character in the CC and they look just as good in cutscenes which is already an improvement over previous titles. Hair options are awesome.

[b] - The Performance: [/b] Flawless. On my 4080 with everything set to Ultra and all the Ray Tracing, I've had zero hiccups. And so far I've seen no bugs and experienced no crashes. It's been a while since I could say that about a AAA release.

[b] - The Graphics: [/b] Environments look awesome. There was a puddle in the opening mission that blew me away. The reflections, the physics. Chef's kiss.

[h2] The Bad: [/h2]

[b] - Voice Acting: [/b] This is my biggest gripe with the game. It's just incredibly bad and the majority of NPC's have their lines delivered with little to no emotion. I hate talking to companions and NPCs. Neve's is particularly unforgivable given she's one of the first people you meet in the game. I checked out after meeting a character from the comics I had been looking forward to meeting in game for years. Her acting was so bad and her lines were delivered like an NPC quest giver in an MMO. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and caused me to turn off the game.

[b] - The Writing: [/b] It leaves a lot to be desired. Conversations end abruptly as if the writer didn't know where it was going or simply where to take it and often left me asking, ""that's it?"". When my companions give their companion quest, they'll literally say one line of dialogue, giving my Rook no chance to respond and the conversation ends, and a quest is added to my journal. I feel like my Rook barely speaks and when she does, I feel no connection to her as a character. She feels like a passenger in her own story.

[b] - Nuance: [/b] 
Continuing my criticism of the writing I want to bring up self-doubt as it feels like all of my companions have it as does my Rook. The game has just begun and it feels like there's no reason for this. There was a scene early on where my Rook looked in a mirror and reminisced about her past. It became apparent she had self-esteem issues and there was an interesting option where I could talk about my tattoos. This would've been fine if the dialogue options didn't say something cliché like ""this is part of who I am"". As a tattooed person, this came across very forced and I've never once relied on my tattoos for self-esteem. I had a conversation with Varric where every line amounted to ""I can't do this, Varric, I need advice"". I wanted some degree of self confidence in my hero where doubt comes in later in the story due to a major setback. In Mass Effect Shepard began to doubt themself after Virmire, toward the latter part of the game. There was context for this because Virmire felt like a big failure and the bad guy got away. It then took the advice of a squadmate to uplift them and spur them to action. This common story beat instead takes place at the beginning of The Veilguard and it's jarring.

[b] - Side Quests: [/b] I did one side quest and I really don't want to do another one again.

[b] - Squad Balance: [/b] I picked a mage and I'm yet to recruit a single warrior. The game is linear and so far I have 2 mages, including my Rook, and 3 rogues, only one of which is melee focused. Did they assume everybody was going to pick Warrior? As a result my squad is imbalanced and I'm currently serving as my squad's tank. I'm forced to pick electric spells as a necessity because it's the only way I can prime detonations with the current selection party members. I'm particularly annoyed by this because I didn't want to RP as a lightning mage.

[b] - Mission Structure: [/b] It's disjointed. At first it had the linearity of God of War then transitioned into what I seemed like it would be a Mass Effect 2 mission structure but it didn't quite land. It's something really weird that I can't explain and it doesn't feel enjoyable.

[b] - Puzzles: [/b] Some puzzles do require more thinking than Matty and Skill Up gave the impression of. But I don't enjoy them and they feel like unnecessary additions. Not fun, more tedious than anything

[b] - Previous Choices: [/b] Obviously being a fan of all previous games, my choices not carrying over is a huge negative that I was willing to look past if the game was good. So far nothing has been so great as to justify this baffling decision.

[h2] The Ugly: [/h2]

[b] - Combat: [/b] It's fantastic. Mage gameplay feels like a better Hogwarts Legacy and this is the best the mage class has felt in a Dragon Age game! I've played every single Dragon Age on Nightmare, but this one feels a lot easier. I don't feel like the game is well-balanced because there was an insane difficulty spike when I went on a mission to recruit one of the companions. After that mission it went back to being ridiculously easy again. It took me 4 hours before I felt like I needed to use a healing potion and it was 5 hours before I died for the first time. I don't know what to make of it so it goes here.

[h2] Conclusion: [/h2]
If you're a fan of previous Dragon Age games, I don't feel like this game is for you. In fact I'm really not sure who it's for and I struggle giving it a recommendation. Many people seem to like it but my friends who are Dragon Age fans share many of my opinions. I played BG3 for 20 hours straight on release without realising, I was having so much fun. I remember going to bed and I couldn't wit to wake up and play it again. I managed to play 11+ hours in The Veilguard, and I went to bed disappointed and today I don't feel like playing it right now. I usually wait until completion before I write my reviews but I couldn't with this one. I will try again later and If I change my mind about the game down the line, I'll change my review, but as it stands, I do not recommend Dragon Age: The Veilguard",1730462761,1730462816,False,589,4,0.867871880531311,3,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

It took about 62 hours to do so and my biggest takeaway from this game is that this isn't a BioWare game. 

BioWare made it's name on ""your choices matter"", then boiled down 200 hours of content down to three questions and destroyed every former region in what feels like a scorched earth attempt to say ""We're done here, stop asking about things from Origins/2/Inquisition because they're dead and now there's no going back"" and that nothing that we did in those three previous games mattered because it's all gone now anyway. 

It feels BAD. It feels like a betrayal and sellout for a modern take and a fresh audience who aren't going to care about those things. If you're new to the franchise, you may enjoy it, the combat is formatted to align with more modern games and if the vibes match what you want, then go for it, but if you're a longtime Dragon Age fan looking forward to this game, my biggest and most stern recommendation is to not play it. It will not meet your expectations and will ruin what love you had remaining for the company.

The problem with Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a game isn’t about the presence or absence of any particular agenda. It’s not even about the shift away from the dark fantasy tone of the first game, as the BioWare director pointed out, saying that fans of the first game are no longer the primary audience, and therefore their voices don’t really matter much (even though early reviews by journalists mentioned a “return of BioWare,” and the developers themselves said they wanted to go back to their roots and regain fans’ trust).

How they plan to achieve that while doing the exact opposite of what fans ask for is a mystery to me. The game has a lot of flaws: boring characters, spoiling the main Dragon Age: Inquisition twist within the first 40 minutes (which was one of the main reasons I preordered the game, even though I had low expectations for its quality - at least the plot was intriguing). Overall, the game has become almost childish, as if it’s now rated PEGI 12.

The characters are completely uninteresting and lack any depth. The dialogue is just terrible, and as an RPG, it plays poorly. If it weren’t part of this franchise, I’d say it’s below average.

I also want to point out the discrepancy between the user score and the metascore on Metacritic (critics rate the game highly while players are, as usual, angry). Furthermore, for me, the mostly positive reviews on Steam are also surprising. I read positive reviews, and they literally say the game is average or below average, yet they give it a thumbs up!

This installment feels like a cheap Marvel production to me. Despite the mixed reception of Inquisition and its own controversial aspects, next to Veilguard, it now seems like a masterpiece.

The optimization is worth noting, but most of the time, you’re running through narrow, corridor-like locations, and aside from the occasional reflections, the graphics don’t seem much better than they were ten years ago in the previous game.
The combat has become purely action-oriented, without any turn-based elements, which is a matter of taste, though overall the combat feels energetic. However, the enemy design (including the darkspawn) now looks downright cartoonish and cringeworthy.

I’m someone who, in my own way, enjoyed both the second and third games and love the first one, but I consider this one not just the weakest but an outright mistake. The game lacks soul, it’s not engaging, and it feels like Starfield but in a fantasy world (bland and gray, despite its bright colors in design).",1730647982,1730647982,False,2135,15,0.8661412596702575,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

I caught up with all previous Dragon Age games and their intricate stories, learnt the lore and deep world building. I hyped myself up through every piece of media I could find.

When the first trailers came in, I told myself maybe the marketing team didn't know what Bioware was cooking in the forges. 

Then the reviews dropped, and my enthusiasm was split down the middle, I chose to believe, and lean on the side of the positive reviews that this game could be great.

And then I finally played it for myself. And this game is a comfortably luke-warm 6.5 ~ 7 of out 10. It's a far from being the utter flop the negative reviews have all claimed and professed; but it is absolutely not the game anyone of us truly wanted, or really expected. 

Pros:
-    Game runs very well, and is optimised excellently, as pointed out in the Digital Foundry PC tech review.
-    Environment, and Graphics are subjectively incredibly gorgeous, with some stunning vistas. (Although the big Disney-Pixar heads are a strange art choice.)
-    At its core, it still is Dragon Age, and die-hard fans with a less critical perspective on game design will find a great deal of enjoyment of seeing their favourite characters on screen once more.
-    Combat is flashy and fast, and somewhat satisfying; A frank improvement over Inquisition's animation slideshow combat.

Cons:
-    Sadly, most of the writing is as everyone has feared from previews and reviews. It's lukewarm and is deathly afraid of getting dark, which I am CERTAIN will sadden most DA fans. It's not the worst writing in the world, and is more than serviceable, but please set your expectations accordingly. It's no masterpiece of writing, and you won't walk away from this game being shocked to your core with dramatic morally ambiguous decisions. 
-    Game is becoming slightly repetitive even by hour 10, which is foreboding for a ~60 hour game. 
-    The game lacks any of sort of major pull, or gravitas; meaning it feels overall quite generic for fantasy rpg. I have nothing CALLING me to continue playing other than the money and time invested.
-    In truth, I dismissed Skillup's review at first, but I am beginning to see his worries are very indicative of my own experiences.

Finished all companion quests and got what I'd consider the ""best"" ending possible. My takeaway is that this is a game written for nobody. This is a reboot billed as a sequel: It REQUIRES knowledge of the series for it's plot to have any emotional impact - yet constantly goes out of it's way to show it's contempt for the lore and previous entries. How could this please anyone? Dragon Age was my first exposure to the Fantasy genre, I care deeply for these stories - and at this point I just hope they don't parade it's corpse around again.

To clarify, I'm not some oldhead DAO purist or a grifter. Origins, 2, and Inquisition all have their respective major faults - but I could always look past them, when the world and story was crafted with such love and care. Veilguard in comparison is soulless drivel, lacking in any nuance. It's unwilling to present any real emotional or intellectual conflict to the player - in a setting that, in many ways, is defined by it's ability to evoke these feelings. 


I got past the simplification of combat.
I got past the cartoon Darkspawn.

But the writing is an insult to anyone that has had any investment in Dragon Age as a series. 

The phrase “marvel tier writing” is overused, but it does apply here. It’s not that quippy dialogue is inherently bad. It’s that everything they’ve presented, be it dialogue, lore exposition, all of it - is HEAVILY sanitized. In far too many instances, the writing is amateurishly immersion breaking. It feels like HR is present in the background of every interaction. This isn't targeting inclusivity. Dragon Age has always been vocally inclusive and I love it for that - but Veilguard is so hamfisted it proves itself the most regressive of all 4 entries. 

Each returning character feels like a half-baked cardboard cutout, a caricature. Why even bring Morrigan or Dorian back if you’re going to strip them of everything that connected us as players to their stories. These moments that should be amazing - seeing these characters again after 10 years, don’t just fall flat - they feel like an insult to the characters themselves.

A lot of blame is deservedly placed on corporate level decisions, but when your writing staff is so fundamentally out of touch with the setting - there was no hope in the first place.

While it delivers stunning visuals and solid technical performance, the gameplay, storytelling, and RPG elements fail to capture the magic of its predecessors.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] The combat system is passable, with diverse character customization. However, the encounters feel tedious. Enemies often swarm you in gank-squad fashion, forcing constant dodging, moving, and flanking to create distance and use skills. The hitboxes feel off, and the over-the-top combat effects—flying elbows, colorful fireworks, explosions, and tornados—are distracting. It’s a departure from the more strategic and meticulous pace of past DA games. Party dynamics are almost nonexistent. Your companions don't take damage, barely deal any, and mainly serve to heal you or create debuffs/combos with limited skills. Once you figure out the two or so synergies, it’s rinse and repeat. Most skills are unremarkable, damage abilities feel indistinguishable, and every non-tank character has a heal. This oversimplification robs combat of depth. Outside of combat, gameplay revolves around revisiting semi-open environments. Prepare for endless backtracking. Progress unlocks new rooms and areas, often requiring repetitive tasks like placing elven artifacts on pylons to disable shields or slicing blight pustules in a specific order to open gates. These mechanics quickly become tiresome.

[b]Storytelling:[/b] This is DA:V’s weakest point, and I agree with the criticism. Characters are barely distinguishable, defined more by hobbies (coffee, crime-solving, griffons, elven artifacts) than personality. The characters exhibit little to no growth in their personalities over the course of their character arcs, with the exception of Emmrich and his hissing skeleton Manfred. Your interactions feel like co-workers on a business trip, and the dialogue lacks substance. The writing leans heavily on Whedon-esque, Avengers-style humor, undercutting any serious moments. For example, after facing a major villain who’s just decimated an army, your character quips, “Oh, crap!” The tonal inconsistency is jarring, especially for an end-of-the-world scenario. The main cast acts chipper, barely acknowledging the devastation around them, while the broader world feels oddly detached. It undermines the dark, atmospheric tones of previous Dragon Age games.

[b]RPG Elements:[/b] DA:V struggles as an RPG. Perhaps my least favouritie aspect of this game is it's loot and inventory system. The looting system is overly simplified, replacing true inventories and resource management with a Destiny/Assassin's Creed-style menus and looting. Gone are the days of managing encumbrance, preparing potions, and planning for quests through strategic resource management. What’s here feels like a downgrade, even compared to Inquisition. Player choices, another RPG staple, are shallow. Rook, your main character, is mostly predefined, and dialogue choices boil down to ""empathetic,"" ""sarcastic dad jokes,"" or ""firm but soft."" Choices lack moral complexity and have little impact on the story, apart from a few obvious moments. This feels like a massive step back from Bioware’s earlier games and an abandonment of their greatest strength

[b]Positives:[/b] The artistic design is fantastic. The environments are stunning, capturing the grandeur of Minrathous and Treviso and the towering elven artifacts of Arlathan. Character design is gorgeous, and facial animations are a standout—much improved from Andromeda. The in-game, in-engine cinematics are some of the most impressive that I've ever seen. The character creator is exceptional, ensuring your protagonist fits seamlessly into every scene. The game is also well-optimized and relatively bug-free. Props to the art and technical teams.

Unfortunately, DA:V fails to live up to its predecessors, and I doubt it will resonate with long-time fans of the series. For me, this is likely the last Dragon Age game I’ll play.

Although I cannot recommend the the game as a new addition to the DA franchise, which are dark fantasy rpg games with heavy reliance on choice, I must say that I am not sorry that I played it as it is a decent 6/10 action adventure game situated in the DA/Thedas universe. 

- The story:
The story is good, but it is hindered by bad writing, especially in the abyssimal first third of the game where everyone is cheery in situations where it is not appropriate and explaining everything to you like you are a child. All missions at that time feel off, noone is in a hurry, you take walks to buy food and other stuff, talk about insignificant things etc. It does get better afterwards, with the last third being the strongest. I especially enjoyed the missions related to the grey wardens and Solas. We also get to fight some dragons. 
Thankfully, there are no fetch side quests. Some of the side quests are simply fighting, but this is still better than collecting shards and chasing goats like in DAI.

- No continuity from previous games:
The biggest player choices in the DA games would affect events across the games and Inquisition promised far reaching consequences with its war table and ordinary missions affecting multiple kingdoms and groups.
However, the DAV team decided to just cross out all of that and make some canon version of the events that suits them without any care for consistency with previous games and player choices in them.
The returning characters are simply different people under the same name – all of them have been changed to look very differently and, what is most important, they are not the same personality.

- The character design does not fit the setting:
some of the characters are too cartoonish (disney style) and with the voices to fit that cartoon look. This, combined with the cheery remarks, kills immersion in what should have been a dark medieval fantasy world at the brink of extinsion. Also, sometimes Rook and other characters smile when it does not fit the scene.

- Lack of choice and a world filtered of anything that can be considered morally gray or bad is the greatest problem of this game:
All factions are unrealistically good - good Crow assassins that never kill innocents, good Lords of Fortune looters who do not steal and have advisor to tell them to return culturally significant artefacts. Isabella, their leader and returning character who used to be free spirited, proud and charming, but also selfish, a thief and a liar – now makes push ups because she misgendered someone.  
Your character Rook is almost predefined, you can select how they look and their faction, but you cannot actually shape their personality (and the overall story as well). When we select a faction, we are given an origin story - we have no choice in that story, we are always the good person who saved innocents. It would have been much better to get an origin story mission and make our own choices (or even select from several written ones in the character selection screen) - e.g. if I am crow, I may have chosen to be ruthless rather than benevolent savior. There are no faction specific missions for Rook as well, making him/her like a junior errand boy/girl for his/her companions's missions. 
This lack of choice continues throughout the game. We have mostly cosmetic choices where we basically say the same thing, but with different tone.  Even worse, the companions just call you, blurt out something that they need which results in a side mission and your character just automatically agrees. You cannot refuse a mission, you cannot kick out a character, you cannot even disagree with their view – you can only support them and say what the devs have decided.

- Interactions with characters and romance:
The interactions in the first third of the game are weakest again (collecting berries, talking to innanimate objects and other stupidities), but if you push through, then the stories and the characters themselves become much more interesting. I especially liked Emmrich and Bellara's stories.
Romance is mediocre and not a big part of the game overall. You have several scripted scenes mostly towards the end of the game and no special interactions (even ability to talk more with that character). Also, they have avoided any conflict when you try to romance several people - this is unrealistic and makes romances feel very meaningless. Early flirting with many characters is ok, but I reached with two characters a point where they express strong feelings, I locked in with one of them and the other never even acknowledged that, as if someone erased their memory and nothing happened.
Rook is largely ignored outside of the predefined cutscenes with companions. You see two of them talking, you come close, they finish their conversation and start looking at you silently like an imposter (they could at least greet you, better yet - include you). If you visit their room, they brush you off. You have no chance to talk to them, ask questions or anything. So I simply gave up and do not interact unless specifically called for.

- Diversity:
Bioware have always been on the forefront when it comes to diveristy and have created some of the best characters across ME and DA games. DAV is not much different, having mostly well fitting diverse characters. However, as there were some heated discussions on ""wokeness"" that could needlessly prevent someone from buying the game, I decided to pay special attention to that - these several scenes with Taash are very small part (maybe less than 1%) of the game and blown way out of proportion. For me, the biggest problem is that the character is written poorly as a teenager personality instead of a grown person, that the writers are using contemporary terms that do not fit and, as with everything else, that you do not have a choice on how to react.  

- Gameplay
Although I do not like action style fighting and would have preferred tactical combat, this one is not too bad. It lacks any variety, however, and gets very repetitive. You basically click the same 2-3 buttons all the time.
They have basically destryed party combat - only two companions and they do not take damage and are immportal. If you are a warrior, you do not have a reason to jump and save your mage and, on the other hand, if you are the mage the enemies will still target mostly you. 
The game is riddled with small puzzles everywhere - they are simple, but the sheer quantity is annoying, especially in the beginning when the maps feel like labyrinths where you solve many puzzles to find a way to move forward. Once you unlock more locations and teleports it is not so bad.

Crafting and equipment:
You can no longer craft, but only upgrade and enchant equipment. While this is not such a big issue for me, the fact that the equipment is tied to a specific character is. I can have multiple perfect rings or armour and I cannot equip it on my companions. I have to search for ones that are labeled for them.",1731865106,1733335141,False,214,0,0.7998550534248352,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

Dragon age origins was a masterpiece, the sequel was great(i dont mind the action gameplay) and i enjoyed inquisition.

But i'm 2 hours in, and a few problems already arise.
The world has dissappeared from this game, every character feels like they went to the same school, same village, we're just running on crash bandicoot tracks, every companion is joking even though the world is ending, and people are supposedly dying everywhere.

I hope this gets more dragon-agey, but initial impression is bad, the immersion is not there yet.

I feel out of place with this character, a nobody who just happens to make friends and meet every npc from the previous games x.x feels like cheap cameos in a railroaded movie, rather than characters you can have a meaningful interaction with.

What's this ""starting out as an allknowing hero"" when every dragon age game has been a game about slowly being introduced to the world through your character. It feels like Rook might aswell have been the inquisitor from DA:I, since he/she is so determined to save the world, despite having no real connection to it.

At this point i feel like assassin's creed has better dialogue options and choices.",1730400162,1730400340,False,11734,124,0.8987913727760314,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

I love dragon age, and have respected the series writing and ever-improving dialogue since origins. I have played over 1000 hours of inquisition alone. Dozens of playthroughs on various platforms. I’m also non-binary, and was so excited to hear there’d be a non-binary character in this game - only to find it a mostly offensive, overly sanitized, infantilizing mockery, which felt deliberately crafted to make certain cis players to feel good about themselves and for EA/Bioware to check on a box and pat themselves on the back for.

That is all to say this game felt like a direct insult to the entire craft, thedas, and fans as a whole. I have legitimately never felt this upset about any piece of media. 

i tried so hard to give it a chance, and at nearly every turn found myself disappointed. But I’ll start with what i managed to cling to while making it through to the end:

The environmental assets and style are beautiful, finally lining up with concept art we’ve seen BTS since dragon age 2. My couple complaints being that darkspawn are indeed a bit goofy looking, and elgarnan and companion villains a bit generic and cartoonishly offputting.

The gameplay, on the latter two difficulties (excluding nightmare mode) is pretty good! There were encounters i genuinely enjoyed. It does, however, begin to wear you down if you’re a completionist like me. i found myself losing interest about 50% of the way through the game, and put it to easy just so i could finish this game and finally sever my relationship with this series once and for all. 

I did genuinely enjoy a lot of the level design, if puzzles were a little more varied, or linked to more interesting mysteries or codex entries, it would have probably been close to perfect for me. It was a bit nostalgic and old school in a way that was mostly comforting, but it may not appeal to everyone, and does get boring with the lack of the aforementioned variety. 

For this next bit I’m going to define a couple things:

Writing: Will refer to plot beats, character arcs, and faction quests - essentially the structural components and their pace.

Story: Will refer to how lore of the previous games is integrated, and the actual moment to moment things that happen within arcs and quests, or what make up the connective tissue between plot beats.

Dialogue: will refer to the craft of word for word writing - sentence structure, naturalism, tone, prose, and era appropriateness. 

With that established: they’re all terrible. I genuinely find nearly every choice of word and plot point in this to be offensive to the very craft, let alone the series. I never could have imagined how bad this part would be. Average? Boring? Maybe as utilitarian as your staple Assassins Creed entry? But THIS? THIS??? This is insanity. 

Teen Titans, Over The Garden Wall, Avatar The Last Airbender, Spongebob - what do these *children’s cartoons* have anything to do with Veilguard? Good Question! They all have infinitely more prose, tension, conflict, wit, self awareness, and naturalism in dialogue and plot than any given moment in this game. I am genuinely baffled by anyone and everyone saying any part of this is “good”. I find it perfectly understandable to *maybe* find moments here and there *potentially* enjoyable — and concede that there are, in fact, very good *ideas* established — but i honestly am having difficulty understanding how those things weren’t thoroughly ruined for everyone by their soulless delivery and the bitter taste of all that surrounds them. 

The vocabulary in this game barely exceeds sophomore year of highschool, and lacks anything you could call close to prose — let alone the flowery subtleties and witty implications of its predecessors, particularly Inquisition. Information is given freely and repeatedly, names and locations are repeated unnecessarily and incessantly, lore is dropped unceremoniously, and the game constantly spoils what’s about to happen by having characters discuss their “theories” before embarkment — all of which are, always, always, perfectly on the nose. 

Anytime I managed to perk up at something potentially interesting, the game almost immediately answers any potential questions i might have delighted in before they even finish brewing in my head, destroying any sense of wonder or mystery that could have been so easily procured; had the game shut the fuck up for a single maker-be-damned moment. At the games absolute best, this would happen during the proceeding scene, but many more times than that it would happen within one or two sentences. I found this absolutely infuriating. 

Companion quests are cartoonishly immature, not only in tone, as nearly everyone points out, but in their very inclusion of certain ideas, tropes, and expectations of the player. Unique villains are established and given little to no empathy through dialogue, choices, or portrayal all the way up until their final scene, within which, suddenly! You and your companion (depending on who it is) decide that maybe you could reason with them actually, or maybe this one shouldn’t die actually.

Every moment feels like i’m being forced to feel something completely unearned by the game. Veilguard is CONSTANTLY *telling you* how you should be feeling — whether it’s through the laughably coaxing soundtrack or directly through companion dialogue. We think this guy is evil, we think this thing someone did is bad, this thing happening is sad — with nearly no ability as the player to question or share an opinion that isn’t in some form an agreement with everyone else’s assessment of the situation. One moment, every thing from the music to Rook to your Companion to Environment art to *the immediately preceding events* are telling you that this person is almost certainly unredeemable, the next you are practically gaslit by the game when Rook and Co share their Actual fully formed opinions that are either passed off as always having been nuanced, or some weird mix of “they deserve it but i feel bad but they deserve it”. 

[major spoilers i guess if you got this far and still give a shit]
Characters have absolutely baffling backgrounds that often make very little sense within the context of the world — |parents dying in a building collapse instead of literally any of the dozens of established things that get people unceremoniously and perfectly unfairly killed in this series, every single day: war, famine, robbery, darkspawn, blight, giant scorpions, dragons, demons, wandering into chasind territory, qunari, dare i continue? —Our non-binary character not knowing anything about the term (WHICH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WOULDNT EXIST, AND COULD HAVE BEEN LORED INTO SOMETHING COOL HAD IF NOT BEEN FOR THE ALREADY RELATED TERM IN THEIR HOME LANGUAGE THAT THE GAME EVEN BRINGS UP) even though they are 20, have traveled extensively, and are in the same organization that harbors at least one notorious non-binary braggart, in an organization of braggarts, in a culture of story telling, that also happens to have an extremely convenient hub in which they gather frequently to brag their storied exploits, and who are all sort-of-pirates - yknow, just the most unconventional, historically gender defiant group of freaks to grace our real life earth???|| I could go on for each companion, but it would require me to go back and refresh myself on all the parts of this game i sincerely cannot wait to forget. 

The overall writings pace is clinical: every character feels perfectly calculated into having the same amount of screen time, quality or context be damned, and certain types of scenes feel like they required x# of one kind of choice and y# of another. This ends up giving a very strange feeling to the timing opportunities Rook gets to speak. There are many moments that feel like the player should have control and didn’t, and many totally unnecessary moments of control.

BAH CHARACTER LIMIT

1. The gameplay is very pleasant, it's nice to run, it's nice to fight. Attention is paid to things that infuriate in many games, like unnecessarily long animations of climbing / getting off somewhere: everything is fast and smooth here.
2. The locations are very beautiful.
3. Leveling of the equipment is done surprisingly wisely. You're not messing up a bunch of low lvl junk items. Instead, equipment cannot be sold, each item is in one copy and when you would have to find/knock out/buy the same item, the one you had is improved instead. It may be a disadvantage for fans of managing things, but it was not bad for me, because over all these years I was already tired of the ""traditional"" approach to loot in RPGs.

Now what I didn't like about the game:
1. Cartoon graphics cause dissonance. Almost all the main characters and NPCs are unsympathetic: big heads, strange body proportions, ridiculous clothing designs.
2. The game is absolutely weak and childish in terms of the behavior of your character. You can't be an asshole (hello DAO and MAE), you can't even be just sarcastic, selfish, greedy, indifferent, or anything else that deflects you from the goody-two-shoes mark of a fool.
3. The game is absolutely weak and childish in terms of the behavior of other characters. Negative characters are caricatured and uninteresting, they won't even risk insulting you in dialogue more than ""you're a fool"", and even there are few of them. The world is like everyone is afraid to talk to each other normally. 
4. The game is absolutely weak and childish in terms of partner conflicts. Yes, that most important part of the Bioware games is completely ruined.
5. The romance with the character I chose turned out to be a dummy. There was no chemistry, it seemed like my companion wasn't interested in my character at all for most of the game.
6. The frivolity of everything in spite of the content of the plot, up to the point of absurdity. We have two evil elven gods here staging an apocalypse, corruption is spreading on a scale never seen before, but the priority will be to discuss how to talk to someone properly. And these are not isolated cases, this is regularly the case. There is no atmosphere. Blood mages? Demons? Slavery? Templars? Conflicts with magicians? Well, all these things that set the tone in past games? They do not exist, except when they pop up in the dialogue in the context of ""slavery is bad, venatori are not good people, okay?"", and then we return to the discussion of ""important"" things.
7. There are a lot of puzzles, but they are all so simple that they can only break a six-year-old's head, and even that is not a fact. And after a couple of hours, they don't get any better.
8. ""Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated"" according to Bioware, in practice it's running from one note/letter to another. Most of the quests have no depth, they are uninteresting.
9. Dull and monotonous fights. The opponents present no challenge. You spam with an auto-attack, and once a minute you trigger some kind of combo of companions, because the cooldown has passed. 
10. As a continuation of the previous point, leveling does not make any sense when you can have only 4 skills and you will almost never use them. The ideal solution is to set an easy difficulty level and simply perceive each fight as a necessary routine. There are no tactics, no planning is needed, you can throw leveling points anywhere — what's the difference.
11. The illusion of choice. In 9 out of 10 cases, choices are 3 options that do the same thing. At best, they will influence which of the characters will approve of it (but approval feels like it doesn't do anything either, you can't even watch it). In conversations with your teammates, you have three different approval options and nothing else besides them. 
12. Many players speak positively about optimization of the game, but I had such bugs: textures in locations periodically disappear, the store loads for a long time, after a lot of special effects on the screen the game crashes, and sometimes when I load the save, my character's appearance changes to a default bald character.

The combat was fun, sure, but at the end of the day this just can't be called a 'Dragon Age' game. It's a generic fantasy adventure game and not even a true RPG. There are very, very few choices that actually matter and have any impact on the outcome of your story (maybe like 5 in the entirety of the game) and there's really only one narrative path to follow unlike the previous games, so there's not really any point to re-playing as a different faction or race to see content you might have missed out on. It just doesn't exist because they didn't develop them enough. I really tried to keep an open mind going into it but the lack of Worldstates carrying over is really felt throughout as you play through the story. Certain characters from previous games have also been entirely removed in favor of establishing a main 'cannon'. The cities and landscapes look beautiful, but the character models are jarring at times and the dialogue is even more childish, cliche and cringey than your average Marvel movie. Your companions constantly under-react to lore drops and the lore drops are poorly executed, with far too much 'telling' rather than 'showing' and immersing us in the engaging story told in the first three games. 

The culture and cultural nuances of Thedas are almost completely absent, and in many scenes and story missions the dialog and story being told acts as if Rook isn't even there. The experience is very much like watching a trashy CW tv show that was given way too high of a budget for what they gave us in return.  Certain characters like Isabela are also completely unrecognizable. In 100 hours I was also never able to get past the ridiculous looking darkspawn 'ghouls' and Demons have basically been removed from the game. The companions shout 'demons' when entering combat with 'demons' all the time, but what you are actually fighting are undead skeletons and hooded spirits. Pride Demons have no faces. There are a few ogres. You get to fight a lot of red boil covered ghoul looking darkspawn that remind you of Left 4 Dead zombies. That's pretty much the extent of the enemy models (besides humanoids) and none of them instill the same fear and ambiance that the previous games darkspawn and demons did.  

The dev's trying to say that this game has the 'best romance' in any of their games is also an outright lie and it's honestly kind of embarrassing that they really said that publicly. The companion quests are incredibly shallow compared to both previous DA games and Mass Effect games. It feels like several steps/missions were skipped and the companions suddenly start acting like they've become Rook's BFF somewhere in the middle to end of the second act when I felt like I barely knew who these characters were and Rook hadn't even had very much interaction with them yet. The romances are all severely underdeveloped with the exception of Emmerich, followed by Davrin who still needed a bit more. Lucanis feels blatantly unfinished and has more chemistry with his beloved Antivan Coffee than Rook. Shepard in Mass Effect 2 gives you more feels just sadly staring at a photo of Kaiden than what you get with Lucanis (lol). 

The most painful part of it all is that there are so many moments where you can see what the game could have been, and how it wasted it's potential to explore the actual world of Thedas and add to the overarching story and experience. That's not even taking into account Joplin, which is what the game should have been and was the game all of us wanted. Instead Bioware traded in what they were best at (immersive narratives and storytelling) to become mediocre at combat. And let me tell you... while the player combat is fun, the companions take several steps back in terms of combat usability. Their combo skills can be powerful when you direct them, but the companions themselves lack the ability to take out enemies on their own. Throughout the entire game I would consistently work on wiping out a mob, then turn around to see where my companions were and they would BOTH be fighting the same one enemy they were when the combat started and not even have it down to half health! I might as well have been playing the game solo, especially given how little interaction Rook has with them.

There are a few high points in the game that remind you of what Dragon Age is supposed to be, like the Siege of Weisshaupt, the Grey Wardens faction, some of the silly codex's you find out in the world, learning more about the Dwarves, Varric, Solas just generally being his a$$hole self, Assan, Manfred and the little bit of Nevarra that we get. But there are too many more low points like Rivain, Tevinter, inconsistent and mangled lore, absent culture and lore (the Chantry, slavery, templars, racism, etc), the bland and forgettable musical soundtrack, disconnected companions and Rook, poorly executed attempts to be gender inclusive (which on it's own is a great concept, they just didn't do it well or with the social sensitivity it deserved here), one dimensional adult companions that act and speak like teenagers, lack of agency or true choice (all of the dialog options on the wheel basically sound the same. You can't be mean or even rude in most cases), lack of player worldbuilding... the third act (which is often said to be the 'best' act) actually felt incredibly rushed to me with many paths on the maps leading to dead ends with a single codex, random enemies that didn't seem to fit the area, on top of the horrendous cutscenes of the companion characters doing meaningless Marvel-style posturing in the final battle... I could go on and on... Basically almost everything that made a Dragon Age game feel like a Dragon Age game is absent from the game. 

So if you are a new player and this is your first entry into the series you probably won't have many of the same issues listed above. But if you love Dragon Age and Thedas, I honestly feel that you'd be better off not playing Veilguard unless you can really disconnect and not look at it as a DA game. For me personally it adds nothing to the series despite all the lore drops and I strongly disagree with a lot of the narrative choices that are made for us and the limited options we're given, so I can't even consider this a cannon game for my Worldstate. For me Inquisition was the last game in the series and in my Worldstate and it ended in a cliffhanger or open ending. There's also enough in the comics and other media available to craft your own personal ending in a much more satisfying way. It's just a massive disappointment and more than a little heartbreaking that this is what we got after 10 years. 

As a generic fantasy game I'd give it a 6.5-7/10, but as a Dragon Age game it gets a very generous 4/10. Will likely never play again and instead replay the first three games again to cleanse my heart of this massive disappointment and nightmare before putting my favorite series of all time to rest. I don't have high hopes for any new Mass Effect, Dragon Age or any other 'role-playing' games Bioware may put out in the future and don't really see myself playing any of them if this is what they'll all be like.",1736225738,1736679785,False,95,1,0.7896478176116943,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

Let me save you time and keep it short and sweet. You like Dragon Age? Don't buy this, watch a letsplay. You invested in the lore and wanna see the story through to the end? I'm sorry for the time and money you're about to lose see above. You like unga bunga action and don't care what's going on? Maybe this is the right game for you on a sale or discount.

This is the worst Dragon Age game to date, a terrible Role Playing Game and a middling action game. The debut trailer for this game was accurate. You know the one that was generally lambasted and derided for being off-tone and thematically divorced from anything related to Dragon Age.

If you are a fan of the Dragon Age series, if you have ever been invested in the rich tapestry of stories and characters that this series has showcased I'm sorry.

Again short and sweet
Combat: Serviceable, a departure from the series traditional tactical combat. Personal opinion, This is basically Mass Effect and that sucks. The reduction of party size from 3 to 2 feels like it was done only to facilitate the ME combat model. This leaves you with a unbalanced combat loop that also manages to hurt the games ability to deliver the story and let you engage with the characters.

Dialogue and Narrative: it's awful, just fucking awful. Character dialogue is now written in a very modern tone that feels completely disconnected from previous series and closer to a Marvel movie. The quality of the writing is also much worse than previous titles. You may hear some people dismiss this criticism by saying ""the writings never been great"" or ""it's a video game, who cares?"". My response is that it's actively bad, the dialogue when delivered brings the experience down. Dragon Age as a series has always had a central pillar built around a strong story experience and every time these characters talk they chip away at it until Veilguard collapses and breaks apart.

Role Playing and Choice: There's none in this game so not worth talking about. btw I am not joking or being facetious or hyperbolic or exaggerating. There is no roleplaying in this game. You are good person Rook. Everyone in your party has a good nature and wouldn't kick a puppy. You're the Veilguard, You're the heroes, and your going to save everyone and your boring and blah blah blah. The flanderization spreads to other named characters in the series which comes off as unnatural. The worst part is how conversations and dialogue are delivered everything is ambient dialogue or a cutscene. You do not talk to people, you just listen or watch. You cannot ask your companions questions, you cannot learn more about them or the world or their factions. You do not engage with the story it is instead presented to you.

Everything else/rants: Doesn't matter, I didn't like it. Though special mention to the music which for a handful of scenes and areas worked ok. Every other track though fucking terrible. I'm hearing synth beats in a fucking fantasy game, makers breath it's not worth getting into. Also special fucking mention to the shit maps. Shop Vendors outside of the faction vendors are not listed on the map so the only way to find them is to wander around and hope you remember where they are. Further compounding the problem street names and location names are not listed either which makes navigation even more of a pain in the ass, who let this release like this?


In Summary: The previous Dragon. Age games were like epic novels, that you could replay over and over with a depth of character and breadth that you rarely see duplicated anywhere else. Veilguard is like a terrible summer movie. In my personal opinion Origins is like a Song of Ice and Fire and Veilguard is like Game of  Thrones S8 or Thor: Love and Thunder. This game hasn't killed my love of the Dragon Age series but it wasn't for lack of trying.",1731376636,1731376636,False,618,5,0.838279902935028,7,False,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

And I say that not to take part in any kind of culture war, nor even as a particularly big Dragon Age fan. I played Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2 but I was never a massive fan, I liked them well enough to play through them both to completion but never really replayed them. 

In fact, I have quite a few good things to say about this game if I just take it for what it is and ignore what a poor job it does as a sequel; I like the combat system, I like the visuals, I like the character creator and I like the cinematography. They're all great. The hair physics are great. Even the story might be interesting, but I can't truly say that for sure.

And that's because of the writing. The writing is so, so awful. This could possibly be one of the worst written games of all time, certainly one of the worst I've ever played if not the worst. Within the first few hours of the game, you just go between one group and the next regurgitating the same information over and over, and not even in particularly interesting or new ways. You don't learn anything in the introduction through dialogue. Everything that's talked about is something you witness with your own eyes, but it repeats it to you over and over as if you'd forget what you saw and heard in the past 5 minutes.. every 5 minutes. It establishes almost nothing, just padding out time.

The dialogue 'choices' are non-existent. It's a complete illusion of choice. Maybe the dialogue options lead to your character saying something slightly different, but ultimately what is inferred is the exact same. There is also no wit. The 'witty' options in Dragon Age 2, for example, were usually funny; often snide or sarcastic in a similar way to Alistair in Dragon Age Origins. In here, it's nothing. I played for 5 hours and didn't so much as crack the slightest smile, despite taking what's supposed to be the funny option multiple times, in the vain hope I might just get something even mildly amusing.

But why I've only played 5 hours and dropped it is simply the constant banal babying the game does. The breaking point was when I entered a certain area with torture devices all over the room and mutilated bodies on top of tables with sharp torture implements littered around them, and the best thing one of my companions had to say was 'these people have been tortured'. No shit, really?

Wow.

The worst part is the writing being bad means there's absolutely no way this could possibly be salvaged by mods or something. It's ingrained into the game itself, it permeates everything, and you can't enjoy any aspect of the game for long because you're constantly being assaulted by offensively bad dialogue and characterisation.

As of writing this review I've played 5 hours.

I do not think this is a bad game per-se, but it is not something that I can recommend. Veilguard is a game that is intended for a specific audience, and that audience is not me anymore.

I've played a good amount now, past the opening hours, and I think at this point what I've seen is a good reflection of what the game has to offer. There have been some moments that I've enjoyed, but at the end of the day this is aimed towards a younger audience, and the story is written to reflect that. It results in something that is less mature, less complex, and less interesting than its peers, or even other Dragon Age games.

I'm not oblivious to the fact that Dragon Age has been trending this direction since Origins, but this is the first time where I just can't enjoy it or look past something that is written for an audience I am not a part of. I played each of the games again in anticipation to this one, and I don't think I intend to ever finish this one. It's not for me, and I don't think it's necessary to push through something I'm not enjoying just because I've waited ten years. I've made peace with it, and it doesn't ever take away from my enjoyment of the previous games.

But understand what you are going to get if you decide to play. The tone is much lighter, it's much less mature, and is the end state of the gradual sanitization of the series as time has gone on. Writing and banter does rely on quips, humor, and immature delivery. Some of these characters genuinely do not feel or talk like adults. It is especially unfortunate because the times when the game did decide to be serious, it was good. But that is exception, not the norm.

But does that mean that Veilguard is a bad game? No. But it's not for me, and if you want a mature game, one with narrative complexity, or adult dialogue, it might not be for you either. If that is something you can look past, there's actually stuff here that I think is objectively good. The combat is among the best of the series, the art style looks better in practice than promos, the music is great, and there is a lot of companion interactions and cutscenes.

This isn't what I hoped for after waiting ten years, but after finishing Inquisition, I think that was a fine place to end things. This is where I say goodbye to Dragon Age for now. Maybe one day there will be a shift back to a tone and writing that attracted me in the first place, but if not, then it was a good run, and I don't regret my time spent in this universe whatsoever.",1730486421,1730486421,False,176,0,0.7735987305641174,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

I am 4 hours in and I still don't feel like the game has started. My immersion in a Dragon Age game has legitimatly never been lower than these 4 hours. Player agency is non existent, I don't feel like I've gotten any opportunity to RP, or develop my character at all. I have no idea who this dude is, I don't feel like a part of the world, and the characters all blur together into a singular lifeless entity. Everything feels like a set, you get plopped into scenes at a rapid pace with no chance to explore. There has genuinely never been another game in the series that has felt so completely on rails and uninterested in letting the player actually interact with it. And the dialogue. Oh god. Not even just the player's, which is abysmal, but the dialogue in general is written so badly. Characters repeat themselves over, and over again like you're too stupid to have heard them the first time. Here is an example of what I mean (paraphrased but the gist is there): 

Character A: we’re searching for the Nadas Dirthalan! It’s an archive spirit. 
Character B: Nadas Dirthalan?
Character A: Yes! It’s a spirit that can tell us all about the ancient elves history!

A few minutes later

Character A: We’re close to the Archive Spirit! I have so many questions to ask it. 

Another few minutes later, we meet it, it disappears.

Character B: Well it’s broken like all the other artifacts here.
Character A: it’s not just any artifact! It’s the Nadas Dirthalan! The Archive Spirit! I have so many questions to ask it!

*fade to black, teleported to new location* 

Character A: blah blah something something Nadas Dirthalan
Character C: Wait! You met the Nadas Dirthalan? The Archive Spirit? We could ask it about the ancient elven gods!

If they aren't repeating exposition/objectives at you, they're using the most corny and predictable filler dialogue. How many times have you heard ""It's quiet here... TOO QUIET."" cuz it's got that. I wouldn't be surprised to hear a ""He's standing right behind me isn't he"" or a ""Well that just happened."" I guess this is what we're left with when EA decides to fire their best writers for the series.

8 hours in and I still couldn't tell you a single thing about these characters beyond one or two word descriptions. I could list a fact or two about them, but I really am getting absolutely no personality off them. Everyone feels so cardboard. The only character with a shred of personality is almost entirely due to the talent of the voice actress portraying her, working hard with a piss poor script. 

Part of me feels awful, hating this game so much. I want to make it clear that zero of the reasons to hate this game have to do with inclusion or ""wokeness."" I wish people would stop making it about that, it's a nothing criticism, it's an entirely artificial conflict, and it's made the fanbase into yes men who refuse to look at the game critically or accept anything but praise for what is so obviously a lazy game devoid of anything that made these games compelling. To the people who decry this game out of bigotry alone: the Dragon Age series has always included explicit queer identity and giving the player more options to express that aspect of their own character is a positive in my book. Having more LGBT characters or options for players to explore their own character's identity in a game does nothing to you. Get over yourself. Unfortunately, it's in a shit game that has no place calling itself part of what was an incredible trilogy, and yes, for all of DA2's short comings, it is still leagues better than this game. There is a STARK contrast between the two, actually. DA2 had a ridiculously rushed production, had ambitions it couldn't deliver on because of executive meddling and STILL managed to tell an incredible story with rich, memorable characters.

The reviews were right - Tonally inconsistent, and changing/ignoring lore send strong soft reboot vibes, blatant God of War ripoffs (turning to squeeze through narrow openings), companions during combat are invincible so I don't care about them at all (neither do my enemies apparently) and its annoying to have to constantly set up their powers.

I had high hopes for Dragon Age: Veilguard, especially as a dedicated fan who has replayed the original trilogy multiple times. Unfortunately, this latest installment falls short in almost every area, delivering a lackluster experience that feels both shallow and patronizing.

[b]Character Design and Development[/b]: The characters are bland, nearly indistinguishable from each other, and lack any real individuality. Instead of the rich personalities and complex relationships we've come to love in Dragon Age games, the companions in Veilguard come off as part of a homogeneous clique where everyone just gets along with no real conflict or friction. The absence of a renegade path is particularly frustrating—there’s no room to shape your character’s morality, making the game feel like it’s forcing you down a single narrative path. This erodes the sense of player agency that was so strong in previous games.

[b]Gameplay and Combat[/b]: Gameplay feels like a step back to the corridor-running days of Dragon Age: Origins, with an uninspired, linear level design. The combat system is oversimplified, offering only three skills per character, making every battle a monotonous button-mashing affair. The lack of strategic options and meaningful skills turns combat into a chore, devoid of the tactical depth that Inquisition introduced with its flexible skill sets and party commands.

[b]Story and Lore[/b]: The story is weak, disjointed, and lacks the epic, branching narratives fans expect. Choices made in previous games seem pointless, and any attempts at world-building feel half-hearted. The lore feels retconned to the point of absurdity, with changes that make it feel more like a piece of fanfiction than a true addition to the Dragon Age universe. As a long-time fan, it’s disheartening to see the rich, cohesive history of the series treated so carelessly.

[b]Character Creation and Visuals[/b]: While character creation has marginally improved, the aesthetics are still disappointing. No matter how hard I tried, my elf protagonist looked unnatural, with awkward facial features and disproportionate body shapes that felt cartoonish rather than realistic. This is especially frustrating given the advancements in character design in other recent RPGs.

[b]Inclusion and Progressive Themes[/b]: The original games balanced real-world themes with nuanced storytelling. However, Veilguard feels overbearing and heavy-handed in its attempts at ""progressiveness,"" often to the detriment of the story and immersion. As someone who values inclusive representation, it was disappointing to find that the execution here felt more like a checklist than an authentic, integrated part of the world.

[b]Final Thoughts: Ultimately, Dragon Age[/b]: Veilguard is a lackluster, regressive addition to the franchise. It lacks the compelling story, character depth, and intricate gameplay that made previous installments memorable. As a die-hard fan, I wanted to love this game, but it misses the mark on nearly every front.",1730580544,1730580657,False,317,2,0.759822130203247,13,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

The gameplay leans more into action RPG territory, making it feel less open and free than past entries. While it's still an enjoyable experience, I personally found ""Inquisition"" more compelling.

The game meets my expectations, although I was hoping for something closer to the original experience. My main complaint is with the pacing. The story often feels rushed, as if it’s racing toward the next plot point. For instance, when you reach a faction, they instantly reveal everything you need, and moments later, you’re already at the central object of the questline. It lacks the gradual buildup that I enjoyed before.

Additionally, I’ve run into a technical issue. In larger cities, I experience what I call ""stutter phases."" My FPS drops dramatically to about 3, with GPU usage plunging to around 20%. This stuttering lasts for 5-12 seconds, after which the game stabilizes back to a smooth 60 FPS for around 5-20 minutes.

I write this review at the end of Act 1 after roughly 35 hours of gameplay, so perhaps these issues will improve with more progress into the main story - but even then, the pacing of such exposition is terribly late. (Edit: after a couple of hours more I have sadly decided to DNF this game)

As a character driven, storytelling rpg, this game is sadly both underwhelming and disappointing. Decades of worldbuilding has been swept under the rug: the cultural challenges that we faced in the previous trilogy seem forgotten or deliberately omitted, opposing factions are simply Bad Guys without redeeming qualities or intriguing motivations and allying factions are unproblematic to the point where their past questionable reputation has been retconned in favour of allowing every organisation to be the Good Guys.

The main gripe I have - revelations made at the end of DA:I that have world-changing implications for certain cultures are simply reacted to with: ""Oh! Okay :( Anyway"" and the villains' main military forces make absolutely no sense to me, and isn't explained well enough that I am convinced of it either. 

The world also forgets to be a character. The highlights of world- and character development happens in codex entries, that are well written but leave me wishing these lore tidbits were better communicated through gameplay. Each area feels like a content island that's simply a set dressing for gameplay lacking any life or nuance. You can no longer interact with *any* NPCs (or even your own companions) outside of the occasional ""press A to hear a short voiced line"" or scripted cutscene. 

It is a world devoid of life that serves as a more arcadey video game platform, as it attempts to do what God of War does but without delivering the same level of mystery and forlorn atmosphere that makes that world interesting. This game certainly could have benefitted from a Mimir style narrator to give context and commentary on the lore we otherwise no longer encounter.

I feared they would turn Solas into a Johnny Silverhand. Now, I kind of wish they had - just so that he could have given us a more nuanced perspective of the world.

As a Dragon Age fan who has been here for every single release since DA:O and loved every single game in spite of launch controversies, this is the first one I am severely disappointed by.

It was dark, gritty, humorous, disgusting at times, and even had romance! As a woman who has been playing rpgs since Everquest in the late 90's, it had everything I loved. However, the only thing Veilguard has in common with the previous incarnations is the name and setting. Seriously, there's not even any blood sprinkles on my character after battles. Dragon Age has always been dark fantasy, not Hello Kitty for teens. Yes, Inquisition wasn't as dark as the first 2 but it still felt like a DA game. This doesn't at all. 

From the beginning, the story falls flat. The intro of the player character is weak and you have to actually go into your lore menu to find out why you are there at all. The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever experienced in a game and I have been playing World of Warcraft for 20 years (it has had some pretty horrible writing over its 2 decades). Then you have the graphics, which obviously don't follow the other three in style. I have seen people comparing it to Pixar but to me it's more Fortnite-esque. The Darkspawn models couldn't scare a toddler. Definitely not dark at all. 

Combat is clunky, the story is just not good, and it simply doesn't feel like a DA game in any way, shape or form. I cannot fathom all of the positive reviews this game is getting. I can only speculate gamers are too intimidated to tell their real thoughts for fear of backlash. I don't care about all that noise. DA has always had a more progressive bent, though it handled it much better in the past.  Tell me a good story, have good characters and game play, and I will play any character you want me to. Sadly, so far Veilguard doesn't have any of that. I'll finish the game because, as they say in poker terms, I am ""pot committed"" to the DA franchise at this point, but I am very disappointed in this entry. I can see why there will be no DLC. I'll probably edit this review once I have completed the game, but unless there is just some super awesome amazing surprise waiting for me in game, I can't ever see recommending this game.

I fell in love with Dragon Age Origins, played Dragon Age 2, enjoyed the open-world of Dragon Age Inquisition and was looking forward to this installment in the series. Unfortunately it falls short of any expectations you may have had. While the graphics are amazing any other aspect of the game is poorly implemented. 

Combat can feel incredibly floaty at times with seemingly little weight behind your attacks. Enemies are just an amalgamation of colours rather than distinct opponents. The darkspawn, a major theme in the Dragon Age world, have become a side note. The world itself is no longer open-world but linear in its design, this does not have to be a major drawback but the depth of the gameplay has suffered with it. Whereas in Dragon Age Inquisition you had mounts, different potions and a real tangible inventory you now have.. nothing. There exists mere corridors to fight in and to perform the odd simple puzzle, none too riviting. Moreover the writing is not particularly strong in this game. 

Overall the game is a step backwards from Dragon Age Inquisition and you get less bang for your buck as it is much shorter. If you are a fan of the Dragon Age world you will still get some enjoyment out of it, no doubt, but not because of the greatness of its design. Any fun is fueled by the already established lore and the strength of the brand created by old Bioware. I would not recommend this game to anyone who hasn't already been craving a new Dragon Age game for ages, therefore a thumbs down from me.

Rook, the story, the companions, all make it so hard to be pulled into the world. It's mainly the writing is bad. I'm 6 hours in with regards to content for reference, but really would not recommend this game.

Rook is just an empty character and kept empty by unimpactful dialogue choices at every turn so you just feel like you're trying to be everyone's pal. Your dialogue options are usually ""Agree Cheerfully"", ""Crack a Joke"", and ""Agree Sternly"". I'm incapable of hurting NPC's feelings, so I stayed away from the stern options at first thinking that was the asshole option, but it's already become my default because it's normal by comparison.

The nobody stumbling into heroics trope is fine, that's how the whole series kicks off stories, but this time you didn't even stumble into it. Varric just hired you sometime before the game and now you're in charge. Paper thin backstory is given for why Varric had even heard of you. You've been friends for a while now, don't you know? Even past that, compared to every other MC in the series, why does Rook even care?

The very front of the story is good, ramping up quickly, but then turns straight into railroaded companion collecting once you get past the marketing/demo/early access content prologue. You just hop around the world to get the next one right after the last. And I mean right after, there are actually cutscenes that teleport you back to the hub right as you resolve a mission/quest for and get your new friend. It's pretty jarring.

Not one of these companions so much as blinks when you ask them to join up with a stranger to Save The World. Not even some coincidental ""wow my fate is bound to yours, guess I have to"", they just nod their head and pledge their life to you freely. This is where it really feels like a Disney or Marvel universe story, everyone is just so damn heroic and selfless. The stakes are the world but everyone is cracking jokes and risking their lives like they're invincible, so there are no stakes.

And the companions themselves. Beyond the whole levity problem above, they are fine in isolation. There are good concepts and archetypes here, but as a party/team nothing comes together. There is zero interpersonal conflict: no dilemmas, no differences of opinion, no conflicting motivations. At one point, I decided to leave a man behind to die and there wasn't a word of discussion between my companions, just an X approves and Y disapproves notification to mark his passing. Everyone is just superficially supportive of everyone else at all times, and it feels so.. bland.

Everything else is fine. Just fine. But that's not enough when it can't tell a story.",1730515967,1730515967,False,308,0,0.7508331537246704,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

Fuck EA and fuck whatever fungus is currently operating the decomposing corpse of Bioware.*

I can't recommend this game. I hoped that the hate was unjustified, and that people were only hating because of the prominent LGBT inclusion, but unfortunately this game sucks and I refunded it after 3 hours.  

For some context, I was a massive Bioware fan, multiple Nightmare playthroughs of all previous Dragon Age games + DLC, ~600 hours playtime, KOTOR 1+2, Jade Empire, the works. I even love Dragon Age 2, which was always considered the canary in the coalmine for Bioware.

I have two separate gripes with this game, the Writing, and the Gameplay. 

For the Writing:

I started this game with some skepticism, but an open mind. I've seen bad reactions to overtly inclusive games before, and most of the time they're unjustified. I support inclusivity, and I hate whitewashing or cultural appropriation. I believe appropriate representation and respect for source cultures is very important in fiction. Too often we see North African/Middle Eastern mythology being whitewashed, and it does suck.  

I'm Irish, and I can't say what I said above, and also not be mad about the changes to the Elves in this game. Elves in Dragon Age have always been inspired heavily by Celtic mythology, they always had Irish/Scottish accents and were based on the downtrodden of the British Isles. They were pasty famine-headed people who were either in serfdom to their Saxon overlords, or living in nomadic exile. All of a sudden they are a diverse pick and mix of anything goes ethnicity, with the only consistency being their suburban East Coast American accent. It's tone deaf, disloyal to the series, and it's bad writing. 

The dialogue in general was also very low quality compared to previous games. Everything is on the nose and overexposed. In the 3 hours I played I had the entire context of what I had just experienced explained back to me 15 times. The Dragon Age franchise has always been mature, and at least somewhat subtle. This felt like I was watching an episode of Ben 10.

I could go on, but the tldr is they turned this into a Marvel movie. (The newer, worse, Marvel movies.)

For the Gameplay:

I could excuse bad writing, even in a story-centric RPG, I could cut the game some slack and give the writing a chance for a few more hours, if the gameplay was ACTUALLY GAMEPLAY. I put this game on Nightmare difficulty, and I proceeded to left-click my way through three hours of nothing combat against THE SAME ENEMY. If you like pressing one button to kill the same miscellaneous Shade creature with no possibility of ever losing, this might be the game for you. However, if that is you, I expect you could save yourself some money and buy a lava lamp to lick instead. 

The combat is lazy, there is no depth or strategy, and there is no difficulty to it whatsoever. I understand catering to a casual audience, and I fully support the inclusion of Story mode/Normal difficulties for people who don't play a lot of video games. But Nightmare difficulty in this game is left click simulator. On top of that, the environments are empty, with nothing to find but more miscellaneous crafting materials and gold which I presume will give me access to some gear that will make the game EVEN MORE TRIVIAL. 

All in all, this is a D tier game with the Dragon Age brand slapped on to try and bait people into buying it. It's boring, it's transparent, and above all else, *it's a reality enducing hammer kick to the balls of the last hopeful Bioware fans. Fuck EA and fuck whatever fungus is currently operating the decomposing corpse of Bioware.*

[h1]My background with Dragon Age[/h1]
I am a long-time fan of the series. I have played each of the entries several times for hundreds of hours. I even bought all of the games multiple times on different retail platforms due to some versions no longer working properly. Even today, I frequently dig out the old titles to play them.

[h1]Dragon Age - The Veilguard[/h1]
[h2]The Good[/h2]
The game is not a bad game for what it is. I actually do like the visually stunning environments. I appreciate that the developers avoided EA launcher and DRM integration. Additionally, the official SteamDeck verification ensures playablity for years to come, if one ever feels inclined to revisit it.

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
The game deserves a thumbs down for what it fails to be - a Dragon Age game. On the other hand, gameplay is too weak to stand out as an action game either. Dragon Age has always been about more than just a short story with character interaction. It is a story with meaningful choices that spans multiple entries, which Veilguard barely continues. Also, Dragon Age used to be a very mature setting, which involved exploring dark medieval fantasy worlds. Through character progression, one could increase attributes, gain talents and earn a variety of skills to choose from to fight hordes of enemies in strategic combat. One was able to set up team tactics and to take control and give direct orders to set up combos or escape threats. All this was underlined by majestic, atmospheric (orchestral) sound. And also, you had the choice to be nice or rude.

[h3]So what do we get now?[/h3]
* Awful Torchlight-style character models that do not fit in the environment
* Emotionless face animations
* A flashy UI that deserves a constant epilepsy warning
* Highly censored content (no blood, spiders, female curves, rudeness, ...)
* Boring puzzles
* Weird camera movement
* Generic BGM
* Poor writing and bad game decisions that break the immersion:
[list]
[*]One big, happy family of companions. There are no meaningful conflicts or disagreements
[*]The freedom to choose between being nice, nicer, or nicest
[*]Boring and infantile conversations
[*]Repetitive banter
[*]There are no secrets. Everyone throws their truth at you, whether you want to hear it or not
[*]Strange romancing system
[*]Unrealistic cannon-like ballistas
[*]meaningless decisions
[*]...
[/list]
* A limit of two companions one cannot control and that can't die
* Meaningless cosmetic items as DLC
* A lord-of-war-style fighting system
* A limit of three usable skills (plus a few combo elements). Using one party member skill puts all others on cooldown.
* A gated skill tree
* Repetitive gameplay
* RNG gear system with gear that can be used by only one person

I understand why BioWare tries to establish a new fighting system to reach a larger audience, but not why they did not provide an action and a strategy game mode to choose from.

[h2]A few words regarding inclusivity[/h2]
I myself am a transgender lesbian, so I suppose that somewhat makes me part of the ""Modern Audience"" this game is targeted at. In real life, I am happy if I can live my life as the woman I always longed to be, with people either not noticing any difference, not commenting on it, or at the very least, treating me with respect. I was able to find this sense of acceptance in traditional RPGs as well. I don't need (nor want) the whole world to turn LGBTQ+ and have everyone loudly declare it.

Personally, I prefer realistic character editors where I can create an avatar with feminine curves (which Veilguard prevents). Even as a male on phyto hormones, I was able to grow bigger breasts than can be set up for women in this character editor. So how shall I see myself represented or included in this game?

Instead, self-proclaimed ""queerosexual gendermancer"" and game director Corinne Busche obviously saw the need to have top surgery scars included in the game (notably as a prominent dedicated feature toggle, not as just one scar to choose from within a long list of scars). Actually, that would not be such a bad idea if it didn't focus on such a small aspect only, catered to such a niche audience, contradicted the whole setting, and led to losing sight of tackling all the other shortcomings this game has.

In real life, no one chooses these scars; they are simply an unavoidable side effect of the transition process. So why would I want them in an RPG where I can transition whilst avoiding these scars? People playing RPGs don't want to see their real selves represented; they want to escape real life. And how should I imagine sex reassignment surgery in a medieval fantasy setting anyway? Is Volo removing one's breasts with a rusty spoon before gifting his magically infused ""Ersatz penis""? Sorry, it's things like that, that break the immersion for me.

With my female alter ego, I loved to seduce Leliana and Isabella. I liked transgender Krem, which seemed very authentic to me. Seeing him treated with the same respect as anyone else felt truly heart-warming and inclusive to me. I'm fine with Taash considering themselves ""non-binary"". But why do they have to use that 21st-century notion? I'm sure there would be more suitable means to express the same thing in a medieval way.

Despite that, if BioWare plays the inclusivity card, why focus on that very specific aspect? Where are eunuch, orchiectomy, and vaginoplasty scars? Why not be inclusive towards hermaphrodites? How about people with obesity, disabilities, artificial limbs, genetic defects, parasitic twins, you name it? How about being inclusive towards people with Tourette syndrome, anxiety or bipolar disorders? You think that's funny? Actually, it isn't. No one wants to see the marks of their real-life imperfections, humiliations and sufferings in a video game where they want to role-play a life without these burdens. I suppose only people not having such scars would want to roleplay having them.

So how about being inclusive to 85% of all people and providing the most basic features in a character editor - female women and masculine men? It's barely there! So obviously inclusivity to BioWare means including gay and transgender men and discriminating everyone else. It's just too specific and inconsequent to call this game's character editor inclusive. Even worse, by messing with a franchise like this out of a political agenda, it only leads to the opposite of what BioWare wanted to achieve: aversion and hostility towards us LGBTQ+ people. It's pathetic!

[h2]Verdict[/h2]
Given the mixed reception from fans and the game's innovations that diverge from what long-time fans expected, I doubt the game will even reach the break-even point. The game fails to capture the core elements that defined the Dragon Age franchise, which will lead to disappointment among long-time fans. Compared to competing action titles, this game does not stand out either.

I am not willing to pay the full price for the game not delivering the full Dragon Age experience. I don't like action games. I might buy this game on sale once again and force myself to endure the combat system just to experience the story, if it is any good. On the other side, I might quite well just watch some gameplay videos.

This game might mark the end of Bioware, and I meanwhile no longer care. If a software studio does not care about its most skilled staff members, nor the heritage of this genre-defining franchise, nor the opinion of its fandom, why should I care about that software studio? They would have been showered with money if BioWare had listened to what fans longed for just for a second. Unfortunately, the game never fully returned through the veil from its excursion to a live service game. They'd better sell the franchise to Larian than make another ""Drag on age - the fail guarantor.""

In late 2019 I became a more consistent computer game player as I had more time than I did when I was younger. I found and played through “Dragon Age: Origins” and all DLC material available. I simply fell in love with the compelling, captivating, and immersive story; the lore; the companions; the choices; the consequences of my actions…! It was a journey that brough back memories of playing the tabletop first edition of advanced dungeons and dragons with my buddies some 40 years earlier! With an insatiable appetite, I immediately continued my exploration of Thedas by completing all the content for Dragon Age 2 (DA2) and Inquisition (DAI). I spend hours and hours getting to know more and more about Thedas and its people, places, politics, and plights. So, with eager anticipation, I waited ten long years for the next installment of the Dragon Age story…

The following are my thoughts, observations, and opinions of this next installment… 

The game’s character creator is run-of-the-mill. I was not a big fan of all the options and the art style of my character. Upon completion, I felt my rook looked a bit cartoony, disproportional, and too clean/neat. 

Upon completion of my character and starting the game, I felt like I got air dropped into the world of Minrathous’ action without much context as to why I was there. Although I was familiar with Varic Tethras from my DA2 and DAI characters, but as the player character, I could not help but wonder, how do Varic and I (Rook) know each other? How did we meet and why exactly am I here? In other words, what was my back story and how did come to be here? In addition, the more I played the more apparent it became that my character Rook really was not the main protagonist. My character really did not have any reason to be in this role. I mean, other than a quick few lines from a codex entry and some throw away lines mixed into a ton of meaningless dialog indicating your Rook in the main protagonist, there is no tangle reason why your character should even really give a rip about what is happening. 

As for the music, I thought Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe’s composition was out of place and bit too futuristic for the overall setting. At certain times I got the impression I was playing a bit more of a sci-fi genre than a dark fantasy RPG with the music. In short, I would say the music did not help with my immersion into the game very well at all. 

I choose the lowest difficulty level to fully concentrate on the story and it is here where I the most problems. For starters, I found the story to be weak, inept, and quite amateurish! It is clear the story writer(s) for this game were inexperienced and unskilled as they did not stay true to or respect the history and lore associated with the franchise. For instance, my previous choices from all the previous adventures were simply ignored or frivolously disregarded with a brush of a codex entry or throw away comment by a companion or NPC. Really? Is it not this feature that made BioWare such a great studio back so long ago?

Next, the dialog is more modern day and juvenile. It was as though it was written by a complete novice or second-grader. I expected much better from folks who are supposed to be professional game / dialog writers. For instance, the world of Thedas is in danger of being destroyed and the dialog from your party members is pollyannish at best. Their dialog is one of complete optimism and no urgency about the grim things that are happening. If I disagreed with the comment(s) of a companion or NPC, I did not truly have the option of saying something different or down-right ugly. 

And if that was not enough, the identity politics dialog was completely immersion breaking, ham-fisted, and utterly offensive. The writing and interchange by your party members is utterly inconsistent with the established lore and times. Again, in previous DA stories, these types of topics were well written, presented with care, and within the context of the place or society within Thedas!     

In addition to the story, the combat – for me - was a weak, demure, and tedious especially as the game went on. The enemy types are too few and damage sponges. By the end of this train wreck of a game, I did not want to engage in any of the combat because it was just a rinse and repeat from a task lazily done and created. Other, true DA titles not only had dark, gritty villains, monsters, darkspawn, and demons that appeared utterly menacing and fearful, but were each unique, varied with their own attack sequences and patterns. I found this part of the game to be completely void of creative talent and understanding of the previous adventures and lore.     

As for what BioWare and EA did well on this title… 

First, the environmental settings were extremely well done. The non-executive, front-line programmers and developers who worked on this aspect of the game are highly commended for creating an environment consistent to the original concept art and lore of the Dragon Age franchise. It is certainly evident these folks poured their passion into this aspect of the game. Very well done! 

Second, BioWare / EA certainly “rooked” me into believing this piece of work was a “return to form” for the franchise. This so-called “return to form” is an utter lie. It is now apparent that the gaming media is a lap-dog to studios and publishers. The $80 price tag for the deluxe edition was a scam and simply a money grab.   

Third, the “veil” of was kept over this piece of work until it was too late to get a refund. The further I got into this title in name only, the worse it got and I found myself not enjoying anything about it at all!  

And lastly, they succeeded in firmly raising my “guard” for any other products they may release in the future. In other words, I have absolutely no faith that BioWare or EA will be able to deliver a quality Mass Effect game that is true to its lore and that is not riddled with bad writing and identity politics.   

Given the monetary resources available to BioWare via EA, this game does not live up to a AAA game studio title at all! I would not recommend this game at all. It is not in-line with the other games within this franchise. If someone does decide to buy and play this title, I would suggest paying only $5-$10 USD.

Surprises and deviations are only worth recommending if they are better than the expected product.

The writing is shallow. The humor is gone. Dragon Age used to be this great balance of a dark grim fantasy that had a delightful contrast of humor and wit. The grim-wit combo is extremely lacking. I used to be unable to deviate from the humor option in Dragon Age 2 because the option made me laugh. I have yet to see any good witty sarcasm from that option here.

Combat has been interesting. Not as bad as I thought, but also kind of shallow for an RPG. Something nice but not redeeming (A sentence i found myself saying a few times.)

In short, I haven't been able to immerse. I haven't found MY character. And the rest of the characters aren't worth the sacrifice. 

I also find it telling that no DLC is planned. Most Dragon Age games have had very famous DLC attached to it that was a wonderful addition or epilogue.",1730659844,1730659844,False,211,0,0.7439242005348204,1,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

EDIT:


Update after 14 hours:

The dialogue hasn't improved. It's still on-the-nose cringe, and the RPG elements are barely there. So far, there has been only ONE choice presented to the player. There are no multiple ways of handling quests or different outcomes. It's a theme park action game pretending to be Dragon Age.

The combat is... good enough? It’s action-oriented. Not the worst, not the best.

What’s even more frustrating is the decision to remove player choices from past games, making everything you did before irrelevant. This is especially jarring when they keep pushing legacy characters like Morrigan, Isabela, Varric, and the Inquisitor in your face. The way these old characters are used, without acknowledging your past choices, just feels lazy and disrespectful.",1730406780,1730608417,False,536,7,0.7436867356300354,8,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. Okay first of all, let me make sure I understand. My inquisitor disappeared after meeting Solas at the end of Trespasser and then he was replaced by some Rook guy Varric meets in a pub, without elaborating. Then almost everyone from Inquisition, DA2 and Origins mysteriously disappeared while few remaining characters have amnesia of past events. Everyone looks like cartoon characters and dialogue is so simple like it was written by a 4 year old child. I don't even know what to say about emotionless voice acting, robotic facial and body animations (Andromeda, we meet again?), no open world, no party control, repetitive boring combat... Something just isn't right here. What the hell happened to Dragon Age storytelling or Bioware storytelling in general??? Oh wait a minute. All veterans left the company.

10 years of building up Solas as main antagonist, only to be replaced by two cliché bad guys... Then we get introduced to a qunari companion. Oh, and the qunari race? I don't even know how they went from Arishok to this lame and weak af, the very opposite of what qunari race is and stands for. They really did them dirty here. Anyway, this companion apparently is in existential crisis and she says things like ""I hate being a woman."", ""I identify as non-binary now. And I'm going to use ""they"" instead of ""she"" from now on""... then there is also a scene where another character misgenders ""them"" and preaching how to apologize by doing some push-ups? Oh. My. God. I feel as if I entered some atrociously bad fanfiction or ended in a wrong timeline where Dragon Age is not dark fantasy and it was made by Disney. It all makes sense when you look up lead director of this game who describes themselves as ""Queerosexual Gendermancer"", thats all you need to know to understand why there is a lack of talent.

On subject about lgbt: Dragon Age always had gay and trans characters but instead of bringing back old characters that had actual development and story, you know, characters that dragon fans actually loved... they decided to make replacements that can't even hold a candle. And a main objective in this game is romance? I'm saying this as a female: these new characters are ugly, unattractive, and they don't even have a personality because apparently writers identify as non-existent. By the way, did I already mentioned that writing is bad? This is just a deal-breaker for me, especially in a choice-based game. 

If I didn't paint clear enough picture: Lead director is the real main character who made the game be all about himself and to do it, butchered the entire Dragon Age lore in the process. Saying you have divided a Dragon Age community would be an understatement in and of itself... Duncan didn't die for this.

I'm so glad that this will be the last Dragon Age game since after this Bioware won't be able to ruin Mass Effect 4 as well. I'll just pretend this game never existed and refund. Now I'm going back to playing old games before I die of this cringe.

With regards,
A Dragon Age fan of the old Bioware.

EDIT: I've decided to complete this game since I got a lot of messages from people coping saying that I should've played more before I talk. Fine by me, since I'll get to see everything wrong there is in this game so I can warn potential buyers. 

EDIT 2: I was gonna complete this game. I just can't... this is abysmally bad. I had absolutely no expectations and I'm still disappointed. I had to restart the entire game a couple of times because my save files would get corrupted or I encounter a game breaking bug on main quest so I have to reload an earlier save over and over... All my previous points still stand. I wasted 30 hours trying to like anything about this game. This is just a mess. Combat was fun for a few hours and then so boring I was speedrunning. I have nothing more to say about that. 

Rook as character is pointless, just a nobody that has no connection to Solas. Again, why I'm not playing as an inquisitor or Hawke? By the way, Varric is dead and Hawke isn't even in this game. He died in first few minutes of the game gg. 

Dialogue and story writing I just can't stand it. There is no human emotion or connection, no memorable moments. You don't have any options in dialogue, you can't say no, ever. You have 3 options: agree, agree and agree. I can only remember one option where I could choose if I could save or kill someone and that's the only ""evil"" thing in 30 hours that I played. There is no insight into character's history, relationships and personality because they do not talk or act like humans. They are not allowed to have conflict like normal beings. There is no immersion. In Veilguard every race is living together in harmony. They have zero issues and no prejudice with each other. It's like racism suddenly seized to exist in dragon age universe and it's forbidden to even talk about. Everyone is like a hive-mind. 

I'm done. I'm never buying another Bioware game. This company is dead to me.",1730396503,1735064227,False,4252,91,0.8434664607048034,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

Before anyone tries to pull the card that I am blinded by the nostalgia of the previous games, I had finished only Inquisition and only a few months ago. There is no nostalgia influencing my disappointment over the game — it's the game itself that is as bad as it was possible.

10 years of development and nothing had been done right; graphics, sure, this game is incredibly aesthetically pleasing, the most beautiful I've seen so far. Combat was entertaining. And that's where the positives end. 

This game is a disgrace to the fans, to the lore, and to previous creators of the Dragon Age. There is no logic in their actions, rejecting their own lore and creating something new that has no roots, no connection to anything. The childish behaviour of the main characters — I'm speaking of Neve and Lucanis — throwing a fuss over Rook not going to save their city; i ask how one person is supposed to change anything, if whole team couldn't. The fact that support had been turned off after hardening gives me off the vibes of ""You didn't play like I wanted you to do it, so no matter if we're fighting against the Evanuris that can destroy the world, I'll not heal you in the battle, go die for all I care"". The reactions are childish and plain stupid. Not to mention apparently Minrathus relies only on Shadow Dragons? Where are the rest that were helping in previous games? Are they all not there, when it's needed? It's unlogical and ridiculous. 

Companion's depth of character matches the lid of the pot. They are boring, unmemorable and sometimes even irritating in their lack of rationality. Taash is a crime against non-binary people, and I'm saying it as non-binary person themselves — this had potential, yet they had messed up so badly I only cringe when i see Taash. That growling made me physically sick. Bellara is irritating for most of the part, I had to skip her dialogue to not get headache. Neve is even more infuriating, I can't stand her. Lucanis is a huge disappointment after the hype he had received, I feel like he's a poor copy of Zevran. Emmrich, Davrin and Harding are so far the best of the main companions, I enjoyed their quests and never skipped anything. Still, the most interesting characters remain (to me): Myrna, Vorgoth, Viper, Viago and Thea. Give me more of them, and I'll be happy. 

Romance. Hm, non-existent is the best word when I have to speak of Lucanis' one. Spite is cool, I like him, overall romance is buggy, boring and basically have no cutsecens. Merely one kiss and that's it. He was supposed to be steamy and awkward, the only steam that was there was mine caused by the headache I had when I realized how scammed we had been. 

Characters are crystal clear, all have such good hearts, all wants to be saviours and all are oh so kissy. There's no morally grey characters here, there's no realizing. It's all sweet and fluffy that mere thought is making me feel sick. I never thought I'd miss my most hated characters in the Inquisition, but Sera and Vivienne at least had personality and stood up by their believes — no matter how it irritated me to be in the same room with them. They felt real. No one in Veilguard feels real — more like being taken straight from the fairytale for the children. 

The fact we are to choose between Davrin or Harding and we cannot save them is ridiculous. Harding quite literally is has power of Titans, yet she used arrows against Ghilan'nain — the most irrational decision, the developers just wanted to kill someone off no matter how ridiculous it'd be. They nerfed Harding and her power. Did I mention before they go against their own lore? 

Inquisitor. Solas. I was so excited to see them, and i saw them for exactly 3 minutes and 23 seconds. I believe that's the count. Was it touching? A little, because I was rooting for them. But there's not enough, it was hyped and again — fans were scammed. I read fanfics longer than that and made chats in Character.ai with better storyline for them than Bioware did. I don't know whether to laugh or cry at this point. Solas was amazing, as he always is, even if he had fallen to Disney-like vibes slightly as well.

Characters creator would be good if women were allowed to look like women. No breasts, build like a brick. My mother said they look Neanderthal. And she's correct about that one. Is being femme a crime to Bioware? Does the woman need to look and walk like a man so that she can be powerful? This game was supposed to be inclusive, why were women who are more curvy excluded from it? Is Bioware considering their bodies too sexual? Well, oversexualizing them is their problem. Those people deserve representation as well, especially since the company wants to be oh so open to everyone. 

Endgame is good. I enjoyed it. Not as thrilling as I expected, with only one twist that I should've expected and the fact I didn't only shows how impatient I was to finish this damned game and uninstall it. 

Overall, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Maybe new fan that doesn't know the lore and won't have to be disappointed at every minute spent in this game. Literal children could play it, there's nothing they haven't seen already considering nowadays medias. And it feel like they were the target group of this — not adults, considering how naive that game is. I enjoyed first 20h of the game, the rest of it was a struggle to push through and I had to force myself. The happiness I felt when I could finally uninstall this game is unmeasurable.

ALL the way through. I did ALL the background quests, side quests, faction quests, companion quests, and damn near 100% of the map-based content. I didn't skip cutscenes and dialogues because I wanted to feel like a part of the story.

Do I recommend it as a sequel to the Dragon Age series? No.
Do I recommend this as a standalone game? Also, no.
Do I recommend this game period? Not really.


Let's start with the good:
- Combat is visceral, entertaining, and powerful. By far the best in the franchise and the big reason why I finished it out.
- Leveling mechanics are solid and reminiscent of Path of Exiles with available skill trees for each of the 3 classes.
- Items improve, meaning you can keep good stuff and tailor your kit to your specific playstyle.
- Companions, mechanically, and their abilities help to carry fights on and allow for powerful combination moves.
- Character generator is pretty great. Armours, while overdone at times, are cool.

And now, the bad:
- Armours are a bit over the top.
- I wish I could change colour sets for my gear myself, rather than having the same six faction-based colour schemes.
- The rest of the game. The writing, the dialog, the story, all of it.
- No, seriously, that's it.

To preface, none of my critiques stem from the buzzword hot topics like ""Character Sexuality,"" ""IRL Political Messages,"" etc. I genuinely don't care about those. My issues come from how awful the game was in every other regard.


The story plays out with no serious input from the player aside from what brand of good guy they want to play: Positive, Snarky, or Gruff, with occasional opportunities to delve into Whiny, Angsty, and Angry. The companions aren't believable and their storylines are ""Rook! I need your help to kill XXX bad guy from my off-screen past that way I can succeed at saving the world!"" While the main storyline suffers from being boring, horribly predictable, and untrue to the lore built up throughout the franchise.

The writing is an insult to the players, as though the writers are afraid the audience won't understand the ""careful nuances"" of the story unless they spell it out and say it out loud a dozen or more times. The issue is, there is NO nuance. It boils down to ""Good Guys Good, Bad Guys Bad. Good Guys Stop Bad Guys."" All of this leads to the same three-option ending from Mass Effect 3. I felt like I was being coddled and spoon-fed the plot lines every single time.

""Oh no! There's a traitor among our ranks! Who could it POSSIBLY be?! Is it: A) Your Trusted Companion Who Can Do No Wrong, B) Generic Faction NPC #35, or C) Stabby McBackStabber the Unscrupulous? Hmmmmmm, time to spend three hours doing side quests along seven parts of the story to find out who! *GASP!* It was Stabby McBackStabber the Unscrupulous the WHOLE TIME! How could we have POSSIBLY seen this coming?!""
The worst part is, that's not just *one* storyline, that's about half a dozen. For those going, ""Oh yeah? Name them!""
1) Mayor of D'Mata's Crossing turns out to be the bad guy and, if you choose to release him, goes to the Venatori (unless you're a Warden)
2) The Crows Part One: Illario is a Stinker.
3) The Crows Part Two: Governor Ivenci is a Stinker.
4) Knight Commander Lenos is in league with the Venatori. More news at 11.
5) Gloom Howler turns out to be a Warden. Shocker.
6) Solas is a Stinker (option dependent)

Moreover, they sanitize *everything* from its moral greyness. In DA:O you link up with, among many other characters, a blatant human supremacist, an assassin with no moral scruples, a witch who killed men in the swamps, a Qunaari who confesses to having murdered an entire family because the Qun demanded, and a dwarf who... I mean. He's a Dwarf. My point is, there's plenty of ""We have to put the differences aside here to fight the greater foe.""

In Veilguard, none of that is true.

- The Necromancers (Mourn Watch) EXCLUSIVELY use willing spirits to ONLY reanimate the corpses of WILLING dead folks.
- The Crows perform absolutely NO murders during the story that are dubious, and don't seem to ever do it for money on-screen; in fact, the ONLY mention about their murder-for-hire business is a single sidebar dialog in the Lighthouse between Davrin and Lucanis, where Davrin brings it up and Lucanis finds an easy explanation for why it's OK.
- The Ancient Relic Thieves (Veiljumpers) aren't really ""thieves,"" they're just there to protect the woods and LEARN from the archives. All that previous story stuff about Dalish Elves murdering Humans in the Arlathan Forest in order to protect themselves due to fears of the Trail of Tea-- Sorry, the Long March? Yeahhhh, we're gonna conveniently pretend that never happened. 
- The ""Ruthless Mercenary Treasurehunters"" aren't so ruthless, for some reason. In fact, they explicitly hire a Dalish Chieftain to sort through the relics they find so they can ""rightly return them"" to the Dalish Elves instead of... Y'know, selling them for fat stacks like actual ruthless mercenaries would do.
- The Dwarves that we meet don't believe in losing caste, or if they do then it isn't religiously enforced and they couldn't really care less.
- Every paperboy and passerby in Minrathous knows where the Shadow Dragons' Headquarters is because they are THE worst ""underground spy network"" to EVER exist, but nothing bad ever comes of this (also Neve is awful and I wish she died from the Blight)


In closing, nothing about the writing, dialogue, or options therein make me feel invested into the story. It's cookie-cutter generic, it's dull, it isn't remotely thought provoking, and it's sloppily executed. But the combat is fun as hell, so I'll probably play again just for that reason.

However many others have given all of these reasons and more. There is no need to spend to many words on what has already been said. So I will just say how I feel.

This is a YA/PG game that co-opted the Dragon Age IP. This style direction led to every aspect of the story, characters, and dialogue to be reduced to a shallow representation of their potential. This is objectively a massive departure from the previous Dragon Age installments. As someone who has played every Dragon Age game and enjoyed them, I have to chastise the Directors of this project. I am someone that enjoyed Dragon Age 2 and replayed it half a dozen times, and considering the popular lack of enthusiasm for that game I would consider my love for it as proof of my willingness to put up with a lot of negatives to play, and enjoy a Dragon Age game. The people in charge of this project ignored, purposely or accidentally, the very foundational elements of Dragon Age. They then used the lore of the IP to create something that is a low effort copy of many other media projects that already exist. This feels like a 'regression to the mean', a lowering of standards to cater to the basic.

I suppose that a lot of my frustration with this project is also exacerbated by the larger center mass of media sweeping everything that came before away in a tidal wave of immature mediocrity. Many of the stories and universes that I enjoyed for the last twenty or more years have been harmed by this trend. The core audience of these IP's are well into adulthood. And yet someone made the choice to change a mature and deep world and story, began by Dragon Age Origins, originally enjoyed by teenagers and young adults, into a childish adventure game. Someone or someones made the wrong choice. This is an epidemic in media. Netfix's The Witcher, Disney's Star Wars, Bethesda's Starfield/Fallout 76, Amazon's The Rings of Power/Wheel of Time, and many more. These are all stories and worlds that I loved, all were reduced into some sort of modern second-rate disappointments. 

In the end, this is NOT Dragon Age. This is mediocrity that used and abused a beloved IP to create something that cannot be enjoyed by people that loved what Dragon Age used to be. I'm not angry, just disappointed. By all of it.

Quick summary, game is overall more about acceptance, diversity, and moving on in life.
Few good things, ran perfectly fine, environment looks great, and there's lot to explore.

Combat is ok, it's a simplified hack & slash, button spamming style. Light or strong attacks. Mages are practically just warriors, then battle mages, then full on mages near the end. (Dependent on mana build.)
Enemies mainly hard focus you instead of your teammates. This sucks when you're trying to do a combo, but easily avoided by just activating an ability and you don't take damage.
Cartoony, whimsical, cutesy feel I don't prefer for Dragon Age. This includes the enemies. Just unappealing,and not very interesting. Dragon fights are also all the same. So after you kill 1, you know how to beat the rest.

Dialogue is horrible, you hear and repeat the same stuff nearly every cut scene. You ok, you sure you're fine, we got to do this, we're going to do this, bla bla bla. This never changes, the whole game is like this. You will hear the same thing repeated constantly over and over.
I pick an elf, I seemingly don't know anything about elf history or even speak like I'm an elf in the dialogue 90% of the game. Race use to be a part of DA and have an impact on dialogue.
Solas is instantly backlined in the first act. He's not the big threat that was built up. Solas was useless, the whole game, then sacrificed at the end.

Your companion quests, are also just the same thing on repeat. Example being Harding, gets new powers, ""I got these powers, who am I, what am I."" You're still Harding. Next conversation same thing, and again, and again, confront her inner feelings, repeat again...This is the same thing for each companion quest. Davrin, just the whole time talks about how to train his Griffon and if hes good at it. Taash the kid that never grows up and fights with identity acceptance as a non binary and has mommy issues that you need to constantly back her on.
Romance was crap, (Bellara route), kiss > cut to black > finished. 

The world, the game, and how everyone acts and talks doesn't even really feel like there's a threat. This doesn't really change much. Gets more gloomy near the end, but it's practically the same as like DA 2 was in the sense, but more cheerful.
Too much positivity, as weird as it sounds, this game is too good, you can't really be bad, even the ending. Spoiler, at least 2/3 endings I did were the same outcome, just how you reach it changes. Narrative choices have an impact, but 90% of the time I didn't feel they were that big of an impact. Biggest impact is you just grinding the game. Pick whatever choice you want mostly. They're all good choices, just different tones of good. There is no like, you suck, you threw the fight, you cost us, maybe you shouldn't be a part of the team, nothing like that.

This game spent nearly ten years in development- and it shows, both in good ways and bad ways.

Visually, it looks really good. Until we get to the characters.
Character design is one of the most important parts of a ""traditional"" Bioware game, in my opinion.
If I don't find the companions appealing, then the game doesn't hold much value for me as a Bioware title.
The heads are over-sized, and it's a baffling design choice. I'm assuming that there was some sort of broken logic behind it- something along the lines of ""the face is a canvas for emotion, so lets give everyone a MASSIVE canvas"".
Whatever the reason for it, it doesn't land. The design is somewhere between Dreamworks and FunkoPop.
The comparison to the human characters in Shrek is absolutely perfect.
The world itself, though? It looks amazing. And it runs surprisingly well on launch-day, which is rare in the 2020s.

When it comes to combat, it's a win for me. 
I've been enjoying this aspect a lot more than expected.
Forewarning; I did not like the combat in any previous Dragon Age game.
I always enjoyed the writing, the characters, and the RPG mechanics,
but the combat always felt like a chore that I was trudging through in order to access the ""fun"" part of the games.
In Veilguard, it feels like the opposite. The combat feels like a very simplified blend of a Soulslike and one of the Arkham games.
It's not difficult by any means, but it's engaging enough to be enjoyable- especially in comparison to something like Dragon Age: Inquisition.

But the MAIN part of a Bioware game for me is the character writing, and this is the tipping-point that has me dropping a downvote.
The actual stylistic design of people in general is bad, but then you have the specific design of the companions making it all even worse somehow.
Then you take those bad designs and slap a terrible personality on top, 'brough to life' by abysmal writing, and voiced by what might as well have been an AI from 2020, all the forced-diversity of a McDonalds advertisement, and you have the entire roster of companions summed-up.

The writing feels like it would be at-home in a Rated-E version of Fable.
Nothing is sincere, nothing strays too far into ""dark"" territory, the only time things get ""serious"" is when characters turn into sock-puppets for the writers to preach their sermons at you.

If you align with the propaganda that they've been peddling during the marketing-campaign over the past year, then you'll probably enjoy this game- go for it. It has all the colorful, safe, friendly, sterile content that you could ever want.

If you were hoping that this game was as nuanced and dark as the previous entries in the game like I was, then you'll be disappointed.
The game is exactly what I expected when it comes to the characters and writing- and that's unfortunate.
I was hoping that it was just the rage-bait mob exaggerating the severity of how bad this is, but it truly is irredeemable once you're engaging with any of the writing / characters / world.

Finished the game and I can say with certainty... it got worse. Bioware should have just started a new franchise, not completely erase every piece of established lore that was painstakingly crafted through the previous games, books, and comics. The ""story"" decisions are questionable at best, and vindictively lazy at worst. 
I will admit there were occasional moments where I could see a glimmer of good writing, but those moments always very quickly passed. 
Nearly all of the character interactions felt like a group therapy session of a toxic-positivity day-dreamer. This game is a parody. 

I could go on... but frankly this game does not deserve any more of my attention. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
This game is not a Dragon Age game, not in tone, and not in depth of writing. If you want a game that talks down to you and treats you like a child who cant pay attention to or keep track of a story, then this game is for you. This is not Dark Fantasy, there is no meaningful conflict between party members or Rook that leads to a satisfying resolution. This feels like a fan-fiction written by a high-schooler, with no respect to the original characters or story. You can feel throughout the game, a severe restriction on player agency. There is no ""choice"" available to you as the player, and there is no way to embody the type of Rook you want to be; outside of an ""acceptable and forced"" pre-set stereotypical children's show hero persona. 
Having the same dialogue repeated incessantly is the most irritating thing I have ever experienced in a game, and through this game, I have discovered it as a pet-peeve of mine. So thanks, I guess. 
I would also like to point out... my gripes with this game in this review are NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE DEI added in. I don't give a crap about DEI in games. What I can't handle, is bad writing. 
I played Origins, DA:II, and Inquisition. I have read all of the books and comic books. I tried to like this game, I really did. I thought that if I could push past the drastic art style, combat and UI style, and focus on the story and characters... I could get over my initial hesitation over change. I get that my initial reaction to the game was based on an adverse reaction to change. Change is hard to get past some times, especially with a franchise that is responsible for my interest in games in the first place. My dislike of this game goes past this, however. 
I feel I have wasted my money and I regret my purchase. 
I will complete the game regardless, in a vain effort to remain as loyal as I can to great legacy that came before Dragon Age The Veilguard. The soul of Dragon Age has been killed, and I mourn that.",1730601910,1733198620,False,183,2,0.725371241569519,1,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

Also the ""HR is in the room"" is not a meme. Everything got made very black & white. There's no Renegade option, not even speaking about anything evil.

 In a age where we have RPG""s like Baulders Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and many more, this is game proves that even AAA or AAAA games have their own tiers, and this one is a clear lower tier RPG compared to those.

Combat is engaging for the most part. Tho compared to previous titles of the series is the most simplified it has ever been. Im not far enough to tell you yet if the simplified combat will get boring, but I can definitely see it being so for some.

Main Story is by far the best part, specially if you are someone who played DA Inquisition.  Side quests tho are not nearly to the level they were in previous games. 

Companions, probably the worst part of the game. My main issue is how bland they all are. Each and every single one is so simple and lack complexity to the point they don't even seem like people. Their just 1 trope made into a character.  The only ones that are actually interesting and that I personally enjoy seeing and listening too are the recurring characters from the previous games.

The dialogue between companions is also the worst we have see in a DA game . DA was a series that used to be lauded for its companions and their banter with each other. In this one companion banter is simply there to tell you the Player what is going on. They only talk about things to ensure you the Player are not confused about where to go or what to do. It not there to make you more immersed into the world around them or add to their character depth. They are just constant tutorial voice, you need to pull this level, you need to face the statues this way. You need to find the powerstone thingy, or this fog is thick or why is to so quiet over and over,  tutorial speak, tutorial speak,  tutorial speak.

That sums up this game in a nutshell.  

The old Bioware that made the original Dragon Age and Mass Effect Games is long dead. The original writers and developers are long gone. Bioware is Bioware in name only and a ghost of its former self. 

The writing in this game is dreadful. The dialogue is boring and doesn't give you any real options to bond with the main character who is called ""Rook"" which is really the developers calling you ""moron"" because they assume you are a childish moron that needs everything explained to you in a child like fashion in order to comprehend their story.  They even use the main companion characters to do a kindergarten like sit down story hour retelling to explain the already overly simplified story to you the ""moron"" or ""rook"" who is playing this game. 

The companion characters are mostly unlikable, annoying, cartoonish, and bland, just like the main story. And the game gives you no choice to respond as you see fit as the main character/protagonist, unlike previous Bioware games, where choices did matter and you typically had at least two options to respond where you could be the typical badass hero or if you so choose be the asshole bad guy. This game doesn't allow that. 

The overall character design is like a Disney Pixar cartoon, are mostly ugly and unatractive and doesn't fit the original Dragon Age franchise. They are a far cry from the mostly lovable characters of the original Dragon Age series, some of which do play brief cameo appearances in this game, but not enough to make you fall in love with them allover again. The characters in this game are barely tolerable at best and childishly annoying at worst. 

The world design is okay but not great and the levels are very much guided without any open world elements, unlike the previous Dragon Age game Inquisition where it felt more like an open world game, even when it wasn't one.  This game feels like its mostly on rails and restricts itself and only unlocks certain areas as you progress through the story and level up, placing forcefield barriers between you and the areas of the map that are blocked off until you get to the story part that allows you to progress there. So the game destroys even the illusion of freedom of choice, both in character dialogue choices as well as restricting your travel until the story permits it. 

About 10 hours into this game, the combat starts to feel repetitive. You have already encountered several bosses and the majority of bad guys you will fight in this game, and the game mechanics become a repetitive game of rock, paper scissors. Rinse and repeat. 

The only interesting character in this game is Solas, and he spends the majority of the game locked in a virtual cell. 

Is this a horrible game? No. 

it's mostly cartoonishly bland. But it isn't anywhere near the same calibur as the previous Bioware games of old. So don't expect that.

CONS:
Combat is more action oriented but way too simple. 
The story is slow to build up and sometimes very uninteresting.
The characters are boring although they do get much better towards the end. It simply takes too long for some to become likeable.
Artstyle is questionable, what the hell happened to the Qunari? They look ridiculous. 
Dialogue is pretty bad, the writers treat the player like a toddler and try to explain even the simplest things.
The skill tree forces you to put points into abilities that you don't want in order to get to the ones you actually want.
The ""tactical"" UI was designed for console and it just looks so bad.
The Crossroads area is dull. I cannot force myself to give a damn about it. Instead of trying to make one big puzzle area just integrate those puzzles into the overall world and make it open world.
As an RPG, the worldbuilding in this game doesn't compare to the likes of BG3, Cyberpunk, Witcher etc.
Companions aren't actually companions, more like drones that are there for their abilities to trigger effects. They can't be damaged although mechanics like Taunt exist. They don't feel like actual companions ingame, very similar to Atreus in GoW.

PROS:
Story gets pretty good towards the end. The last 3 hours are so much better than anything else before that point.
Combat feels satisfying despite being very dumbed down. It feels good to combo abilities.
Graphics are pretty good.
Performance is extremely solid, running everything maxed out at 1440 without any issues. Experienced 1 crash in 8 hours but I hadn't updated my drivers yet.
Soundtrack was great.
The character creation screen was great, this game has the most realistic and amazing looking hair tech I've seen in a game.
No EA Launcher, the game is steam native. Thank you. EA App is garbage.

OVERALL:
I can't recommend this game at full price. I wasn't sure if I was even going to finish it. I powered through the first 10-15hours and it got much more interesting. 
If you can get it for 25-30$ it's worth a purchase, however this game ranks even lower than Inquisition, probably only higher than DA2.
My final point is: if you're looking to a successor to DA:O, then play BG3 because this won't scratch that itch. This game has been Mass Effect'ed but not in the ME2 way, more like in a ME3 way. Could've been much better, not a bad game however not a great one either.

1. Lack of conflict. Everyone in the world has the same opinions about EVERYTHING. 
If you played DA2, you likely remember having to break up arguments between the companions Fenris and Anders. Fenris, enslaved and tormented by mages in power for most of his life, was against mages and magic. While Anders, raised in a circle where he lived as a prisoner for simply being born with magic, was pro mages. They were two characters with different experiences and had their own thoughts on the world. 

Now compare that to VeilGuard's Lucanis. With a name as badass as ""Magekiller"" you'd think there'd be some controversy between him and the mages in the party. Maybe there's a reason that he specializes in hunting mages specifically? Nope. It's not even discussed. He's fine with all mages and all the mages are fine with him, friendship at first sight even.
All the character are friends at first sight. In this very diverse cast of characters, no one has a single conflicting opinion. Not even the player. 

2. The dialogue is godawful. Repetitive, stiff, and uninteresting. The voice actors did their best with the scraps they had to work with, but if I have to hear that the ancient elven gods were ""tyrants"" and ""we're the only ones who can stop them"" one more time, I'm gonna throw my pc. I got it the first 15 times thank you. 

3. Missed opportunity. Dragon Age Inquisition broke its back setting up interesting plot lines that could be followed through in the next game. Only three of the options the player made in Inquisition even carried through. The Well of Sorrows is a huge example. Solas should have the power to control the Inquisitor or Morrigan, but that's never touched on, despite both being in the game. No previous questions are answered. Solas himself is a sidelined villain. 


Other than story,  I will admit that the graphics are the best we've seen from Bioware so far, and I am very happy to have long hair options without 1,000 mods. The gameplay is lackluster as usual for Bioware. I'd recommend Witcher 3 or BG3 if you want a plot-heavy game with good gameplay. 
Overall this game should have been a stand alone, not attached to Dragon Age. It's a lackluster story, filled with missed opportunities, annoying one-note companions and lack of depth. You play a Bioware game for the story. And I can't recommended it especially for the price. Wait till it's on sale.

(PS: Did the Inquisitor's arm just grow back? I haven't seen anyone talk about this, but for a studio that prioritizes incivility, making a previously disabled character magically able-bodied seems pretty hypocritical.)",1730749098,1730749098,False,109,1,0.7088820338249207,0,True,False,False,False,1845910,20250114_132040,negative,100

No matter what I did in the character creator my character stayed bug eyed and was extremely distracting in every cut scene that there are an obscene amount of. The game is constantly wrestling control from the player to make you look at something or to play another god forsaken cut scene with laughably bad writing a problem i thought mostly unique to JRPGs but our western friends seem to have taken a note from this book, but its not a book or a movie its a video game so i should, you know; interact with it not just watch it then mash x to make sure i stay awake for the story. The new companions all have the same marvel esque style about them and come across as shitty dnd character inserts rather than fleshed out and engaging characters with unique backgrounds and personalities, and despite what others said they didn't grow on me they just grated against my sensibilities more as time went on.

Veilguard is exactly what it purports to be in the trailers. If you saw the trailers and thought it looked good then maybe you'll like it. If you're like me and cringed at the strange Borderlands-esque character intro cards and styling then I've got bad news for you.

BioWare has taken different aesthetic approaches with each game and Inquisition seemed quite divisive at the time. Veilguard asks the question, ""What if every character looked like hyper-stylized generic MOBA slop?"" If you're optimistic about the full game being different tonally from the trailer you're unfortunately mistaken. Visually the game trades what could have been an interesting and unique style (ie, DA: Origins and DAII) for high fidelity graphics. It's a very pretty game to look atbut BioWare can't seem to nail down a decent anatomical structure. You can see the lack of cohesion when you're playing the game and see a Grey Warden next to a mage like Neve. The look and feel of DA:O is out of place and strange in the world of Veilguard.

So far the plot is fine if not a bit disappointing as they basically hand-wave away the first two games. The game falls apart with the dialogue. I never thought I'd hear a character in a Dragon Age game say, ""well that just happened,"" like some sort of Disney Marvel banter. It doesn't help that they immediately introduce a character who makes Sera seem downright pleasant to chat with in retrospect.

One of my biggest issues with my playthrough of the game is Rook. I chose the Mourn Watch background and am not sure if it's the same with everyone but the amount of exposition is atrocious. Apparently my character led a rebellion and took down some high-ranking necromancers prior to meeting Varric. I know this because there was a paragraph explaining it at the character creation and because it's been referenced MULTIPLE times. This isn't like with other games where you grew up as a ""street urchin"" or ""dalish"" or something. From the sound of Rook was in a WAY better game before joining up with Varric! In the previous Dragon Age games you build your character up from relatively little but in this game it seems like my character got demoted or something. It's very poorly written and comes off as a desperate and cheap strategy to implore the player to think Rook is cool. I'm apparently an all-powerful Necromancer already so wtf am I even doing in a bar fight?

The gameplay is fine but there's definitely a lot more platforming and meandering than I would like. I could see people enjoying the combat but for me it's a bridge too far in the dumbing down of the series. The combat is lifted from Mass Effect and though I prefer those games to Dragon Age I feel the draw to Dragon Age has always been the more traditional RPG mechanics. I wasn't expecting a return to Origins-style CRPG gameplay but this game further reduces customization and is purely squad-based now. It's not the worst thing ever but your mileage may very depending on your taste.

I'm hoping the plot will pull me in soon and I can revise this review in a more positive light but as it stands I'm not a fan and it's a real shame. This game will definitely appeal more to fans of Inquisition.

I tried this game in 2021 and dropped it after around 10 hours due to its unusual mechanics. My playstyle involves immediately diving into side quests and wandering aimlessly, but the game had different plans and wouldn't let me Skyrim'd it.

Fast forward three years later, and the trailer for Kingdom Come II caught my eye. With a newfound patience with games, I decided to give it another try. And oh boy, it did not disappoint. Throughout my 70-hour journey, this has been one of the most immersive experiences I've ever had, rivaling even RDR2

For those who may find the game’s mechanics daunting due to their realism, here are three tips that could enhance your experience base on mine:

[list]
    [*]If you want to explore Bohemia's beautiful landscape as soon as possible, I suggest advancing the story until you acquire your own horse. (Don't just walk around accepting side quests w/o it lol)

    [*]Regarding combat, don’t be fooled by the basic tutorial at the beginning. There’s a more comprehensive tutorial about a quarter into the main quest that really makes swordfighting click and feel seamless.

    [*]The game features several hidden inventory menu tabs that are easy to miss. I recommend familiarizing yourself with these before setting off on your adventures.
[/list]

The limited save system also made me take the game more seriously. Despite a few quirks and some frustrating AI behavior, this might be the most realistic game I've played. Respect the game design, and you will reciprocate a lot more enjoyment as you go along. It will transports you back to a past you won't forget. 

It makes me more incredibly excited for the sequel, especially knowing it's supposed to be released this year!

- go to your game folder: \Steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\ and create new folder named: ""mods"".
- inside mods"" folder create new folder named: ""UnlimitedSavingNS"".
- final path should look like this:
\Steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\mods\UnlimitedSavingNS\
- download MOD: [b]https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/1[/b]

[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]In the game, when you are shooting with a bow, you don't have reticle on your screen. So you don't know where are you shooting with a bow. And with arrow ballistic flying trajectory  and shaky bow hands it's almost impossible to hit anything. Luckily you can enable reticle (dot) for bow with following simple steps:

- go to folder: \steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\
- create new notepad file inside folder and open it
- paste inside notepad file following line: [b]"" wh_pl_showfirecursor=1 ""[/b]
- now save notepad file with SAVE AS option and give the file name: [b]"" user.cfg ""[/b]
- saved file should look like:  \steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\user.cfg

Now you can start the game and you will have reticle enabled for bow aiming. Happy hunting.

The game world is amazing, with fine attention to detail. Not just from historic point of view, but the forests - and there are lots of forest - feel distinctive to this game. In 2023 I travelled to the real-life area where the game takes place and it was mesmerizing - the looks, sounds of the forest was the same as in-game. 

I took a real-life piss where the in-game nobility was camping. 10/10 would recommend.",1712731709,1712731709,True,436,64,0.9391473531723022,0,False,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

It's a great look at how life 'of olde' used to be and it manages to be a pretty realistic simulator in that sense. That said, the game isn't without its faults but the good absolutely outweighs the bad (in that I still want to keep at the story).

Pros:
The story unfolds at a nice pace with plenty of quests and character improvements along the way without dragging its heels much.
Character development (in some respects) can be very quick which is absolutely handy in survival and the game doesn't just leave you out to dry.
There is plenty of exploration and discovery to be had and the game isn't just simply an empty sandbox with choice features here and there.
The environment is absolutely gorgeous and meticulously crafted.
The lore and books they've written are fantastic! I love simply hunting for all of the books I'm able to find and read through them just to take in more lore as it's just that much more immersive.

Now for the cons (I promise, only two of them):
Combat is by far my largest gripe and mainly consists of two parts.
Okay- we're a blacksmith's kid who doesn't know combat. That's incredibly straightforward. Henry has to learn how to fight and that's understandable. What's not understandable is how NPCs can swing their swords up to 7 times in less than two seconds (I've actually timed this) while wearing all of their armor (which of course has nothing to do with Henry's inability to fight) and is just ludicrous fast and realistically impossible. It's insane that anyone ever thought that was a good idea in the first place. ""But it's a combo! You get combos too!"" I've read and heard other folks say. Uh.. okay? Sure? Combos are a part of any combat style (yes of course in real life too) but in a game that boasts realism, that's still not realistic to attack -that- fast with longswords (or even shortswords for that matter).
For the most part blocking works but far too many times I've found hitting and/or holding block the character simply... doesn't. The shield simply doesn't come up (or the longsword, if that's the weapon being used at the time). The NPC is making a simple thrust with his sword and... the game doesn't prompt the shield/block action? That's... that's a basic blockable attack in any form of swordfighting combat.
On the flip side once your combat skills are nearly maxed out, most of your own attacks are unblockable.. which again, makes no sense. The only justification I hear towards this is ""git gud"" which only ignores the terrible design in the first place (again, in a game that boasts realism). 

For the second part- the way the game treats 'being in active combat' is quite... nonsensical. I've approached this and tested this quite a bit (currently I've been in the game just under 80 hours at this point on this Steam account, not counting the hundred or so I put in when the game launched previously prior to updates) and it just makes no sense- bear with me here:
Bad guy knows where you are and is hostile toward you > game treats you as being in active combat. It doesn't matter if you're on your horse and you manage to ride 100 feet away, dismount and he's still running toward you for another ten seconds before he catches up- you're still in active combat this entire time, which means you can't: use bandages, drink any potions, eat any food, change clothing. This exact same behavior persists even when the enemy (example) happens to be an archer sniper in a tower/his post and he stays up there trying to snipe you and you've stepped behind a wall (taller than yourself) so you're in full cover. The game still treats you as being in active combat even though (realistically) you're not actually in combat and nobody is actually coming after you, meaning if you're bleeding once you get into your cover, you still aren't allowed to even begin bandaging and unless you somehow kill that sniper, you're going to bleed out.
How does this make sense? Even a WW1 and WW2 soldier that drags himself into a foxhole in the middle of an active battlefield could start bandaging himself without an enemy soldier running after him (because said soldier would be attacked, etc). That's realism.
The only way to keep things balanced without breaking realism would have been to add an animation for things like eating and bandaging so the player can attempt it (the animation needs to finish) before the effects begin. So you know if a player is dumb enough in a real fight to try and bandage, the enemy is already swinging once again and breaks said animation and you take more damage, having to start over. Nobody should be that stupid but realism would demand the ability to actually try if you wanted and not restrict the player from taking actions 'just because the game says they're in combat even though they clearly have time to do what they need when not -literally- in combat'.

In terms of the environment, it seems that 'impassible bushes' are used more than often in order to block player progression/force a player to go around things. I understand the concept of level design but in the era of swords and knives, it makes no sense not to be able to cut them down and make a path or even still slowly trudge through the brambles with the potential for becoming injured and sick. Impossibly steep inclines would help alleviate this type of map design choice as it's far more hindering than it should be at times and just doesn't make sense in many locations.

Final thoughts: It's a beautifully made game with intricately detailed chunks of medieval life and living, problems ranging from warfare and kings to poverty and religion controlling everyday life and a wonderfully written story but the actual combat is just aggravating that turns to tedious (once you're skilled out), so you're going to have to take it extra slow and learn your alchemy in order to brew specific potions in order to save your game often (and/or sleep often in order to save if you don't go the alchemy route).",1724645490,1724645490,True,147,4,0.8855634331703186,0,False,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

[h2]Pros:[/h2]

- By far, the strongest feature of this game is its immersive late Middle Ages world. It offers a faithful recreation of medieval countryside life and social structures with insane attention to detail. The towns and hamlets feel alive, realistic, and fully functional. Each settlement feels like a real place, both in scale and in terms of its people, with professions true to the era.

- Environments are stunningly beautiful. The visuals are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, especially the open areas, forests, and landscapes. Traversing Bohemia is a pure joy as you soak in the breathtaking countryside and wilderness. Nearly seven years after its release, the game still amazes with its graphical fidelity and realism. The layouts and scale make the world feel authentic, not just like a typical game environment.

- The side quests and stories are wildly entertaining. I’ve completed every single one of them. They feature crazy characters, outlandish events, and surprising outcomes. These quests are well-written, memorable, and inspired by elements of the era, offering loads of fun.

- The soundtrack is majestic and perfectly complements the setting, blending historical and epic vibes. It enhances the sense of epic adventure, while the cinematic cutscenes further immerse you in the experience.

- The characters, from minor NPCs to major players, are interesting, multifaceted, and well-written. They blend historical inspiration with fictional depth.

- The in-game codex is packed with fascinating information about historical events, figures, and contexts, covering everything from social and political structures to daily life. It's both informative and engaging, deepening your understanding of the world and enhancing immersion.

- All in-game skills and mechanics reflect the historical era. You’ll need to learn skills like reading, maintaining gear, hunting, herb collecting, and many more. Most actions require deliberate input rather than a simple click, adding to the game’s realism.

- Maps in KCD are beautiful. They are intricate, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.


[h2]Neutral:[/h2]

- Clunky combat is arguably the most controversial aspect of KCD. While the developers aimed for realism, the result often feels confusing and frustrating—especially if you lack the patience to master its mechanics and unique gameplay (like I did).

- Some optimization issues are still present. Despite running on a high-end PC, I experience low FPS and frame drops in certain areas. Strangely, the game performs better in open areas than in towns, even though nature looks significantly better.

- The voice acting is decent overall. While many important characters are voiced well, some performances sound amateurish or uninspired.

- While the variety of perks is admirable, many are either useless or undesirable due to their mixed positive and negative effects. This leads to awkward situations where the game encourages you not to spend your points.

- The character models and animations are serviceable for a 2018 game but lag behind AAA titles like Red Dead Redemption 2. Many models are reused, lacking detail and distinction. While not outright bad, they pale in comparison to the game’s otherwise stunning visuals.

- The armor mechanics are unclear. The game doesn’t explain how different pieces affect combat aspects like speed or stamina, leaving much to guesswork.


[h2]Cons:[/h2]


- Even six years after release, the game still has numerous bugs, including reports of game-breaking issues (though I haven’t personally encountered these).

- The game struggles with NPC behavior and dialogue continuity. Characters often fail to update their reactions to new events and information, breaking immersion. For example, some NPCs act as if certain events never happened, which disrupts the flow of the story. This problem diminishes immersion and will hopefully be resolved in the sequel.

- Repetitive generic NPC Dialogue. Many NPCs repeat the same lines or slightly varied phrases, which detracts from the experience. Though, it has become a beloved community meme"" (“Henry has come to see us!"" and ""Jesus Christ be praised!” to name a few).

- Lack of dialogue history is a shame. The absence of a dialogue history feature is unacceptable in a narrative-driven RPG, making it harder to revisit past conversations or even track current conversations. However, it aligns with the aim of realism.

- Inventory management is tedious and clunky. Features like item comparison, better sorting options (e.g., sorting by new), and clearer identification of armor parts are much needed.

It is going to get worse, much worse. 

Welcome to Kingdom Come - Deliverance. You are the very unremarkable son of a blacksmith in 1403 Bohemia, and you are just thrown in the middle of a civil war. And you are not prepared for it; everything will cost you blood, sweat and tears. But that is where the charm of the game resides. Every little thing you achieve, be it hunting some hare, winning a match of Chumps on the River (whatever that is), reading a piece of paper, executing a correct three-strike combination with a sword or charming a girl *feels earned*. Because you worked damn hard for it. And it no longer matters that you are not the chosen one, saving a continent from an greater evil. You just scared off a couple of bandits that were trying to rob the local stable, and it means the world to you. 

Immerse yourself in a beautifully recreated piece of Czech Republic (seriously, you can visit some of the locations in real life) with minute attention to detail and unmatched atmosphere. Wander around the most beautiful woods ever created in gaming. Equip yourself in a multi-layered, 16-part equipment system. Ride your horse. Walk your dog. Brew remedies. Pick herbs. Hunt game. Rob. Pick locks. Fight cumans. Charm ladies. Haggle with merchants. Hunt counterfeiters. Join said counterfeiters. Build a counterweight trebuchet. Go whoring and drinking with a priest (actual mission). Dance with the devil (actual mission). Storm a castle. Win a tournament. Fall in love with the best girl this side of Kuttenberg. 

Kingdom Come is a fantastic world where immersion and authenticity is off the charts, revolving around a solid main story, with many different characters, taking place in a beautiful world.

[h3] Gameplay [/h3] 
10/10
Truly immersive and historically accurate experience. It has a realistic portrayal of medieval life and you can visit many of these places in real life today. You feel immersed and part of the a living world. 
PS. google locations from the game and see the google reviews, its amazing.

[h3] Combat [/h3] 
10/10
Unlike many other RPGs, combat here requires strategy and skill. At first you are a lowborn peasant who can barely wield a sword, and after me session with your boi Bernard you become an unstoppable force to be reckoned with. Don;t forget to participate in the Rattay Tourney. 

[h3] Graphics [/h3] 
10/10
The game’s environment is beautifully rendered, with lush forests, detailed villages, and breathtaking landscapes. The attention to detail is remarkable. For a 6 year-old game it looks amazing.  

[h3] Music [/h3] 
9/10
The music is period-appropriate with historically accurate instruments and melodies. I only give it a 9 because I was hoping you could play instruments or there be music related quests like becoming a bard or something. I also wish you could see bards playing at inn and have that music be part of the game. But I do hope they implement this in KCD 2. 

[h3] RPG Elements [/h3] 
10/10 (Best RPG I have played by far)
Deep and flexible character development system, where skills improve with practice and decisions impact your character's progression. Dialogue choices, reputation, and relationships with NPCs all play significant roles in your adventure.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3] 
10/10
Must play for any RPG fan, and with KCD 2 around the corner and looking so promising, there is no better time to join the company of Sir Radzig Kobyla!!

What I liked:
It was 90% of the time a fun, breathtaking and wonderful experience. The Atmosphere is spot on all the time, the Characterdesign is convincing and the Gameplay is solid most of the Time. I felt set back in time to when I was young and played my favourite Game of all time, The Elder Scrolls 4 OBLIVION. So far only Kingdom Come and to an extent Medieval Dynasty have managed to create a similar feeling of comfort and Security like Oblivion did. And that means a f***ing lot to me. The Storys of Main and Sidequests are interesting, entertaining and also convincing most of the time. The Achievement Hunt for all 82 Achievements was for the most part fun and cool, the only exeption beeing the Merciful Achievement which was demanding and even frustrating at times, especially to the End Quests of the Game.

What I did not like so much:
There where many Gameplay aspects that where not exactley beginner friendly and took an absurd amount of time to get used to. 

-For Example the Lockpicking system that, in its Original Form is an absolute Pain in the butt (I recommend a Mod that places Markings on the Lock Screen so its easyer to keep track of where your Lockpick is), 

-the Bow Shooting without a reticle or crosshair and (at least at lower levels) one of the most extreme aim sways I have ever seen in a videogame,

-the fighting system. Oh Boy this is a controversial topic. But let me tell you that it takes the most time of anything else in this Game to get used to, let alone master it. Its hard, unforgiving and brutal. And unfortunally also partially broken. At first its hard but as you progress and level you skill, Level and gear it gets easier. But at one point, I would say around the Levels 17-18 (out of max level 20) the System seems to break and suddenly Combat turns from a legit Challenge to a ""everyone and their Grand-daddys just simply kicks your Ass left and right"". There are two Mechanics that are called a ""Perfect Block""  and a ""Masterstrike"". The Masterstrike consists of a Block and an instant, unblockable attack that does always do damage. Thing is, this is a skill that you yourself have to learn. And the Game literally tells you that this is something only Warriors that have trained a very long time can do and that you yourself will also take a long time to Master this skill. Remember that I said the System brakes at one Point? This Perfect Block and the Masterstrike are the reasons why, because every single enemy in the game, be it a Bandit, a Peasant or an actual Soldier starts to Masterstrike and Perfect Block you 99% of the Time while in Combat. This turns the Combat from a nice back and forth combo and skill based Challenge into either a simple standing and waiting for an enemy attack and immediatley trying to Masterstrike the Enemy if he attacks or a stealth Bow and Arrow shooter Game. The fact that most Bandits at one point suddenly start to run around in plate Armor, which is at the time frame of the game as expensive as a house also doesnt really help. OBLIVION back then already had the Problem of, after hitting a certain Level threshhold, that every single low-Bob-Bandit started running around in the most expensive and high end game Armors. Unfortunally most bandits in Kingdome Come have the exact same Immersion Breaking Problem.

-Talking about immersion breaking. The repeated use of the exact same Faces. Dude. What the F? Together with the broken Combat System this was the thing that annoyed me the most. For example Johannka looks exactley like the Barmaid that Henrys has funtimes with in the drinking Quest with Father Godwin and also like a Bathwench and I dont know how many other Characters. Also in the Quest where you sabotage the Executions of the Kuttenberg Executioner. If you turn around before he starts his Job and look at the Faces of the Rattay Guards that attend the Execution you will notice that every single one of them has the same face, except for maby one if you are lucky. Those are only two examples but this basically happens all the time in the Game and it gets very old very fast. Even Oblivion back then had all their Characters looking completley unique except, you know, for the ONE actual pair of twins. For me this was a big Bummer.

-We also have bugs. Many of them at Times. From falling trough the Map, over wanky Horse controls (doing a 180° on horseback after opening and closing the map anyone?) to NPCs knowing things that they have absoluteley no way of knowing about, (Broken Reputation and Bounty System). U get used to them while playing but its still very frustrating at times. 

In the End I can say that this game is despite many negative aspects, very good and I liked the time I played it but there are things that hopefully get adressed and changed in Kingdom Come 2 when it releases. I can only recommend this game but with a few warnings that I descriped above.

It is very hardcore compared to games like Skyrim. The Kingdom Come: Deliverance world does not cater much to the player, it makes the player work hard to improve their character's skills, abilities, and equipment to survive and complete quests.

The player character is Henry, who is a late-teenage son of a blacksmith. Henry's life is turned upside down during a foreign invasion, and by an unlikely turn of events he ends up in the service of his local lord. That's roughly the first two hours of gameplay, sort of like a prologue, after which the game really begins. Henry, as the son of a blacksmith, knows very little about anything. He's incompetent at any sort of fighting, totally illiterate, out of shape, ignorant about medicine, and all the other drawbacks which come with being a young commoner who has seen almost nothing of the world. Over time, Henry can learn all of these things and become a uniquely capable young man-at-arms, which makes for a compelling rags-to-riches story. It also helps that Henry ceases being an immature fool as the story progresses. 

The real star of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is not the story, which is okay, just okay, but the world. The world is carefully hand-crafted with the most realistic forests and landscape I've ever seen in a video game. The architecture is realistic. The social interactions are for the most part historically-accurate, such as people not travelling much and being suspicious of outsiders while also knowing everyone in their small town. The speech sounds overly religious but is actually accurate; this is how Medieval people in Eastern Europe spoke, and in some places still speak today. The only three places the game really drops the ball regarding realism is the outfits, which are Medieval-inspired but have glaring flaws in implementation (missing crotches on some pants, oversized visor slits on helmets), the lack of crossbows (which should be the primary ranged weapon in that region of Europe at that time), and the use of the same animations for armored and unarmored fighting. 

The combat is not great, not terrible. One on one, it works well enough. The animations are excellent and realistic, I say this as someone who practiced Historic European Martial Arts (longsword fencing). However, group combat is poorly implemented. The AI treats group combat as a bunch of duels, meaning NPCs lock on to one another or onto you and don't care about who might be trying to stab them in the back. The controls for switching enemy targets are clunky, meaning the player also has a hard time of reacting to multiple attackers, beyond just the difficulty of having a fight against multiple people. There is one additional feature of combat called the Master Strike, which is an unblockable parry and counterattack, which seriously cripples the dynamics of combat. It makes attacking extremely risky and defending extremely rewarding, because NPCs can randomly master strike any time you make an attack against them. You can also do the same to them, provided you are high enough level. By late game, duels consist of pressing Q when the enemy attacks and that's about it. However, mods like BCAIC exist to make the combat much more fluid, and with them I feel like my character is in a real swordfight. Archery really sucks, it is difficult to be accurate against stationary targets, impossible against moving ones. Horse archery in this game is a joke. 

Speaking of horses, they are essential. Your only other option is travelling on foot, which will inevitably get you ambushed by bandits and slaughtered in a 5 v 1 fight. But until you get a late-game, super-expensive horse, your horse will throw you at the first sign of trouble and you will again get slaughtered in a 5 v 1 fight. Also, horses have a ridiculously difficult time navigating even minor uneven terrain like small shrubs. Be prepared to rage at your computer when your horse gets stuck on a little bush and you die as a result. Ironic to see this from Warhorse Studios. 

The quests often have many outcomes and ways to complete them. For example, someone can ask you to steal their money back from a corrupt guard but if you are playing a moral character, you can just pay them the money that was taken from them. You can actually even fail at parts of the main quest by making the wrong choices or just ignoring urgent parts of it, in which case you will be chewed out as a useless loser by your superiors but can move on to the next quest through an alternative path. This is a nice difference from the plethora of fetch quests which have come to dominate many recent RPG titles. 

Overall, I recommend this game to people who are into Medieval history or hardcore roleplaying games. My rating is 8/10. I would not recommend this to people who want a game which caters to them and gives them a power fantasy. Kingdom Come is a realistic experience, and like real life it hands out humiliating, depressing, situations alongside the empowering ones.",1708032088,1708032088,True,54,1,0.8257699012756347,0,False,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

I kept my distance, carefully circled back to scout & sneak behind the shed and it's just as I expected! I saw a group of crackheads crouching and ready to jump me at a moment's notice!

You start off the journey controlling our protagonist that looks like a fusion of young Bjorn from Vikings and Schoolboy from Rambo 4. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3375031401
You go here and there and get non essential tasks done to get familiar with the game and learn more about our hero in the process. We see him using his charms on some gal working at the tavern to score some free beer and he makes sure to collect debts to help the family as well. He also gets triggered when he hears political propaganda crap being spread around and he even checks out the behind of the daughter of his dad's client! mad lad!

We've established that our hero doesn't shy away from adversity nor chicks! We got a sniff of what smells like a glorious adventure! 

[h3] And now that we are done with the preamble, here comes the best aspect of the game!~ [/h3]

The game already laid out a good start for us! but Ultimately, It's up to us plebs to ""Shape our Destiny"" just like the quote from Brave Heart ~ Your heart is free. Have the courage to follow it.

* Be a good boi Henry, A young man of Virtue traveling the path of righteousness towards liberation or maybe just be a medieval redneck to enjoy the countryside view and hunt some wabbits.

* Go from Rags to Riches and capture absolute glory by giving no quarter! but pay no heed and you could end up spiraling down the path of a tyrant, imbued in violence and revenge.

* Lose conviction and be viewed by the enemy as weak! You see your character lameness meter go up and end up a wimp, just like when Stan from south park almost turned into a pussy for refusing to eat meat.

* Play the politics game and be a pompous noble or maybe a standard Felon that lie, cheats and steal or maybe just lay waste on everyone and everything around you! In the end, It really is up to you my lord.


[h3] Gameplay: [/h3]

Most things are done manually/realistically and it contributes on how the game is one of the best when it comes to role playing, and immersion. Well maybe they went too much with the manual features for gameplay but there is nothing mod's can't improve in this day and age. I recommend playing the game mod free or with as few mods as possible in your first playthrough tho, The game is already very very good as it is! 

The Combat system is somewhat hectic and needs getting used to. I understand why many players would be dismayed by it, especially in situations against multiple opponents where you just feel like a slab of cheese gettin pushed into a grater. Worst mistake I've done is unknowingly skipped the last sword tutorial part with the knight guy and spent like a third of the game unable to do a ""Master Strike"" before realizing why I'm unable to. Combat can be quite satisfying tho once you get over the hurdle.

The Storyline might be the most historically accurate compared to any other video game, so yeah! it feels like you go back in time often and wonder how lives really were around that time period. 

Lastly are the Random Events, They are great! Sort of Trials that perfectly fit the early parts of the game or it can just be friendly interactions but it's up to you to figure out which is which. My first harsh Lesson - [spoiler] First time that I got ambushed, I was unaware of these events. I approached a dude saying he wants something by a crossroad so I come near him, then suddenly a group of hoodlums sprout out of the bush and trees nearby! I tried to fight at first but got overwhelmed real fast! I got hacked at countless times until they sent me crawling down the river like Leonardo de Caprio in the Revenant! Bled out, Rekt! No Mercy!

One of the most defining aspects of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is its dedication to historical accuracy. The game is set in Bohemia during the Middle Ages and eschews the magic and myth of fantasy RPGs for a grounded portrayal of life in the 1400s. Warhorse Studios conducted extensive research to recreate landscapes, towns, and castles as authentically as possible. The architecture, clothing, weaponry, and even social dynamics reflect what life would have been like in that era. This commitment to realism draws players into a world that feels tangible and alive, offering an immersive experience not often found in other RPGs.

Players can explore vibrant forests, towns bustling with daily activity, and the stunning, rolling countryside of Bohemia, all meticulously crafted to match the historical records of the time. By prioritizing historical immersion, Kingdom Come offers an educational yet thrilling experience, making it appealing to both history buffs and casual gamers alike.


Unlike any other game the combat system in Kingdom Come: Deliverance sets it apart from other RPGs. Inspired by real-life medieval fighting techniques, it’s designed to be challenging and rewarding for players who invest time in mastering it. Unlike many games where combat relies on repetitive button-mashing, Kingdom Come requires precision, timing, and tactical thinking. Players can target specific parts of an enemy’s body and must manage stamina, armor weight, and positioning to gain the upper hand in combat.

Additionally, the game’s weapon system emphasizes realism. Swords, maces, and other weapons have specific strengths and weaknesses depending on an opponent’s armor, making the choice of weapon and approach a strategic consideration. This complex system enhances the sense of accomplishment, as players genuinely improve over time. The difficulty and depth of the combat reflect the brutal reality of medieval warfare and lend authenticity to the gameplay experience.

3. Character Development and Moral Complexity
Unlike many RPGs that give players the power to create and shape their character from scratch, Kingdom Come puts players in the role of Henry, a blacksmith’s son seeking revenge and purpose after his village is destroyed by a foreign invasion. Henry starts as a relatively inexperienced character, mirroring the average person rather than a born hero, which makes his journey all the more relatable and rewarding.

Henry’s moral choices are rarely black and white, allowing players to explore a morally ambiguous world where decisions have lasting consequences. Side quests and interactions often challenge players to think critically about ethics and survival, especially in a time when justice was far from fair or forgiving. This depth in character and decision-making strengthens the narrative, giving players a complex, immersive experience that feels both personal and meaningful.

4. Detailed Progression System and Realistic Survival Elements
In Kingdom Come: Deliverance, skills don’t improve simply by leveling up; they require practice. For instance, if Henry wants to become a better swordsman, he must train with his sword. This grounded approach to character progression makes each achievement feel earned. Players learn from mistakes, building Henry’s skills and knowledge as they encounter the various challenges of medieval life.

The game also introduces survival elements, adding layers of realism to Henry’s journey. Players must manage hunger, exhaustion, and hygiene, making choices that directly affect Henry’s health, stamina, and reputation. These survival mechanics don’t feel intrusive; rather, they deepen the experience by immersing players in the daily hardships and decisions faced by people in the medieval period. Eating, resting, and even maintaining one’s armor are essential aspects of staying alive and being effective in combat, adding to the game’s realism.

5. Innovative Storytelling and Quest Design
While many RPGs follow a straightforward quest structure, Kingdom Come: Deliverance offers players dynamic and open-ended missions that can be completed in a variety of ways. Players are given choices not just in dialogue but also in how they approach situations. This flexibility allows for creativity in solving problems, whether through diplomacy, stealth, or brute force.

The main storyline is compelling, with plenty of emotional stakes, and the side quests are just as engaging. Side quests are not simple filler; they offer intricate narratives, unique challenges, and insights into the characters and world of Bohemia. The choices players make in these quests can have ripple effects throughout the game, creating a world where actions truly matter.

6. An Appreciation for Patience and Thoughtful Gameplay
Kingdom Come: Deliverance is not a game for players looking for fast-paced, action-heavy gameplay. It rewards patience, strategic thinking, and careful planning. Whether learning the ins and outs of sword fighting, navigating intricate dialogues, or finding one’s way through the dense forests of Bohemia, players are rewarded for their attentiveness and problem-solving skills. The slower pace invites players to savor the details and become fully immersed in the world. For players who appreciate a slower, more deliberate RPG experience, Kingdom Come is a rare gem that delivers a deeply satisfying adventure.

Conclusion
In an era where many RPGs rely on fantastical elements to engage players, Kingdom Come: Deliverance offers a refreshing, historically grounded experience. With its intricate combat system, richly detailed world, complex storytelling, and realistic survival mechanics, the game sets a new standard for immersion in the RPG genre. By prioritizing realism and depth over convenience and spectacle, Warhorse Studios has created a game that encourages players to step back in time and experience the world as it was, not as we might wish it to be. For players who crave a challenging and authentic RPG, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is an exceptional choice that stands out for its commitment to delivering a truly immersive, thoughtful gaming experience.",1730909538,1730909538,True,106,0,0.8125103116035461,0,True,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

The best way to play this is to NOT expect tons of hollywood action style set-pieces. This is about living a life in a medieval world where you are just a inept and unskilled peasant who isn't even literate.

If you like actual roleplaying, then this game will provide enough entertainment to be a worthy purchase. Find yourself a regime and plan your day's activities. This isn't like Skyrim where you can stay awake for an infinite amount of time - you will get hungry and tired. You need money to sleep and eat... or not if you decide to poach and live in the wilds.

I was terrible at fighting at first so I got ahead through underhanded techniques such as using stealth and poisoned arrows and blades. See a bandit camp? Dump some Lullably potion into their cauldron and watch them slowly decide that its nap time. Then kill them all as they sleep. Or coat your blade in poison to give yourself a helping hand in combat. Alternatively, you will eventually become good enough to take on three enemies at once in a fair sword fight... but that will take some skill on your part, and good equipment always helps.

This game is best enjoyed when not trying to play it like a game, or trying to min-max or trying to loot everything. You can just play as the town drunk who burgles the nearby town to fuel his booze frenzy before getting into fist-fights before spending some time in the town jail.

There's also a few quests that are really quite fun and have entertaining dialogue.

Are there bugs? Yes. Is there some jank? Yes. Could performance be better? Yep. Do some skills and other mechanics need better balancing? Sure.

The game-play this game presents is realistic, yet fun, and challenging but rewarding to master. The story is a great one with memorable characters. And the graphics are outright stunning.

I have to be honest, my first few hours of the game i was not enjoying it at all, i considered quitting it or just rushing through it... I am glad i did not quit though, yes at first it is frustrating to get used to the game-play and sheer realism, but as you get the hang of it, just as you would in real life, it gets easier, and so much fun.
I went from hating the combat and dying from one foe to mastering it and looking for whole camps to clear. 
They mastered the realism of game-play while just teetering on the edge of not going too far with it. And just like in real life, you wont go from a village boy to a sword master in one hour, so please give the game at least ten hours of play time before you quit, because trust me the 80 hours i ended up spending in this game are one of the most fun experiences i have ever had, and there's still more that i could have done. 
Not only that, but nothing in this game is repetitive or needs you to do any grinding, its all fun unique content.

As for the story, its a pretty good main story that is very memorable and impactful with a lot of great characters. and there are lot of equally good side content and DLCs that will take hours to complete, all very fun.

The graphics look realistic and stunning, with really beautiful vistas, lighting and general environments. And it helps a lot that all the level design is based on realistic locations and history. It is a game that will stun you more than once in its visuals.

Overall, this is a masterclass RPG game, and now one of my favorite games of all time, it truly blew all of my expectations out of the water. I can not wait for the sequel,",1729432271,1729432271,True,46,0,0.7845585346221923,0,False,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

I realised I posted a review of sorts on another gaming website ~6 years ago so I'll post that here with some changes:

Kingdom Come: Deliverance is basically if Skyrim had a lot more to offer than to just hit that reward centre of your brain over and over. Some people praised Red Dead Redemption 2 for having you plan out your days, making notes of what you can do until it's time to go to bed, which is what I was doing frequently in Kingdom Come, and somehow it was all fun and motivating.

Brewing the potions and hunting especially has touches of realism unlike anything I had experienced before in a game. Getting good at those things and the game in general has a really gratifying learning curve without being too difficult. Aiming the bow is the best example as you notice it doesn't have a reticle or cursor, but as you practice with it you realise it's not supposed to have one as hitting targets based on their distance from you is more complicated than that and games that give you cursors are over simplifying things.
I also love how all your armour and clothing carry over into the cutscenes, my Henry looks so buff now because he has 3 or 4 layers on. I was playing the Woman's Lot DLC recently and the NPCs kept making comments about my dirty clothes (you can wash in a trough) so the game world reacts to you like that.

A flaw for me was the sword combat which divulged into shooting arrows to the face at point blank to the armoured enemies, as that was much more effective until I got powerful weapons and armour (or maybe I didn't practice sword combat enough). There was a game-breaking bug at one point which stopped me from progressing in the game until they fixed it I think one or 2 weeks later. Plenty of open-world jank at launch which was to be expected for games that let you go about completing tasks with quite a bit of freedom (came across a couple of hard crashes while playing the game this year, but that's it).

Back in 2018. the guy below was someone you had to chase down for a mission, when I approached him here, he teleported way ahead, got away from me and I had to restart (game doesn't force you to restart, if the guy gets away that actually branches into another quest path, but I really just wanted to catch him).

First of all, this game is an absolute MASTERPIECE, we all know that they didn't have a big team, not that big budget and overall limited means. But, boy, did they deliver(see what I did here?). The story is exciting and interesting, the countryside beautiful, the castles detailed, the cities vibrant... sorry if my review is a bit biased but they just got me hooked on this game haha. Of course, at the beggining you are no more than a peasant brat, who's never held a sword in your hand. You take pleasure with meeting with your lass, drinking at the tavern and brawling with the lads. Then the whole world crumbles before you. And you have to find yourself in all this mess with the help of a few aqcuintances and newly met people... yeah, the game is good. You get a nice horse, a LOT of clothing and wearables, quite limited but still sustainable customisation options. I feel like the limitation of character modifying is one of the reasons that made me fall in love with this game. Warhorse didn't bother changing shite like that, instead they focused on what matters- amazing story, historical accuracy, well written characters and so on! Another matter worth pointing out are the quests. There's a LOT of quests. And each of them is unique in it's own way. In one you have to steal something, in the other- commit the sin of killing somebody. In one you help the poor, in the other- you take everything they have. You can have high honor, or be a senseless thief, who murders for the trill of it. OH, I almost forgot! I should probably say that if you are a new player, DON'T DISCOURAGE YOURSELF FROM PLAYING! I almost did that and that would be a grave mistake! Apart from the game being good, it's also the studio. They are amazing people, especially Tom Mckay, Luke Dale or Sir Tobi haha. Now that the second game is coming out, I just can't wait till February... I digress, don't I? What was I saying? Ah, yes, the quests are exceptionally good... maybe apart from A Woman's Lot DLC quests, where all you really do is just run lol. But apart from that, the game was worth every. single. minute. I spent playing it. I wholeheartedly recommend it to you, and I hope you make the right decision of playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Thank you, Warhorse for making something so good, and thank God he let me discover the game so soon before the new game was announced(I started playing in March, I think?).  I hope my beloved Chech studio makes the second game at least half as good as the first one- it would still be the best game in 2024/2025. May God reward you in health, Warhorse!

In terms of quality, it's more like the Stalker series. Tons of bugs including game and quest breaking ones , tons of ""jank"" with horse riding switching between fun and enjoyable, to a nightmare as your horse seems incapable of walking through many small bushes (in a game with lots of riding through forests...). You can jump them, but if you land on top of them with your horse's feet not on the ground, hope you saved recently.

But, like Stalker, you can feel the love they put into the game, it very much feels like a living world, you can stalk the NPCs and watch them go through their life, you can complete quests many ways (some quests will break though), you can ride all over and find all sorts of weird spots with little bits of lore or easter eggs. And your choices do matter and change how things go for you and your friends.

LOTS of emphasis on ""realistic"", but then certain functionality that would have made things a lot more interesting has clearly been cut. For example, they have a eating system in place but did not build out the cooking system to match it, even though they left all the supporting functionality. Instead you just eat from common pots, you can cook individual food items, but can't combine them to make stews or anything useful, cooked whole onion for supper? Yum!

When it's not glitching or making you want to shoot your horse in the face, it's a really great game which  I hope gets a sequel that they put in the time to make it what this game could have been. Highly recommend unless you can't stand glitchy, janky games that you sort of have to ""put up with"" in order to enjoy.

Tips: If you want a dog, you need A Woman's Lot DLC. You can't feed or care for your horse (gamers want to pet dogs and horses!). Bow suck, or I suck at  bows, either way, not a fan, mostly I use them for rabbits but everything else gets the mace to the face. Starting out, go VERY slow, you suck, you can't fight, everyone hates you, when you meet the fighting trainer, stop and train until you can beat him. Stick to the story to start with, there are a few timed quests and if you go running off like me, you will have a bad time. I have ignored pickpocketing, instead learn to knock people out from stealth and just steal everything that way, way less random luck involved.

You've given me many hours of fun on PS4, the Nintendo Switch and now Steam with your free weekend!
In 30+ years of computer gaming, there is no better. I would even go so far as to say, this game has no parallel.
Warhorse appear to be taking the position Bethesda occupied 10+ years ago in the market.
I'm a 57yo gamer who started playing games as far back as Leisure Suit Larry, through the Half-Life and Fallout eras etc.
My son bought me this and I've got to say, he couldn't have selected better. Thank you Scott!

Let me address a few small negatives first. Yes, there are a few minor criticisms, there are a few bugs and yes, I had to replay from saves a few times. Yes, the save system is a little clunky in the early game. Yes, the game expects a very good PC to run at higher graphics levels. Yes, the body language is corny. Yes, the dialogues are a bit clunky in delivery and there were a few dialogues that were out of sequence. The one thing I did find a little off-putting was how you could form very intimate relationships during quests but after the quest, the NPC would then almost ""Forget everything"" but I won't detail the events and risk spoilers.

When you consider the number of ""Moving Parts"" and ""Variables"" in a game of this magnitude, it's impossible to test and proof every possibility. Remember, it's very easy to pick weaknesses in other people's efforts. Until you achieve perfection in yourself, is it fair to demand absolute perfection of others? Warhorse have been very strong in patching and repairing bugs and issues. they haven't ignored you after they've got your money. That says a lot about the company decision makers!

Now, onto the review. I cannot believe the phenomenal overall quality of this Game.
This game magnificently told the story of a young, inexperienced, unskilled lad growing up to be a real man. Not just another DOOM Guy or Blascowitz saving the world. This story was massively informative teaching the times and values of a bygone era by complete immersion of your character, living the life of a realistic man of the times.
You start out as peasant blacksmith's son, not knowing how to look after yourself let alone others. You have to learn every skill required to progress any areas of your life you want to develop.

The game allows you to steer your character's life in any direction you choose. You can be a hermit, living by bush hunting and foraging, you can be a highly accomplished thief and bad-guy, you can be a high end capitalist or just straight out War-Hero. This game is part game, part Medieval life simulator and part History teacher, with you, the user free to choose the roles and parts you want.
The story telling is highly immersive and somewhat closely following real historic events. There's no shortage of humour sprinkled in, especially as you learn how to drink and party, (yes, that all happened back then too!)

If you're considering buying this game, I'd urge you to experience it as the developers intended, especially on your first play-through. There are countless videos and tutorials on how to exploit the game and turn yourself into DOOM Guy, I'm going to say you'll be robbing yourself of the emotional roller coaster so well delivered if you use exploits or cheats and turn it into a walk-through.
I'll admit, I had to google 3 or 4 answers to riddles I struggled with but don't be tempted to then look at the next ""Game-breaking guide"", it will rob you of the most valuable experience.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, from start to finish and enthusiastically look forward to Warhorse's next venture.
Congratulations to Warhorse, they have fully delivered on their promises.

Lets hope Warhorse learn from Bethesda's mistakes as they grow the company. Warhorse are showing themselves to be what Bethesda was 10+ years ago with an honest, inventive, product and customer focused company.

[/H1]

Well I remember when I got it back in 2021 with my old GTX 1660 this game ran like shit, constant fps issues and etc, so I never finished it, then I got into a job which had most of my time, and this is important cause in this era I already had a better 3070ti GPU etc, but this game is well hardcore QoL. 

Now I'm having the time to properly invest on it, I think this isn't made for everyone, worse is the kind of game you need to get when you have a lot of free time, a death can positively throw away 1-3h of playtime, amongst other atrocious QoL. 

In another hand, this game gives a real medieval feeling, isn't the kind of game where everyone bends the knees to blow you in your horse os something. You really need to go out of your way to learn, thief,knights and so on skills. 

I think the culture of Czech is really well explained, songs are nice too,it's nice when get some random talk events, curses in fight and so on. 

The dlc where you play as woman, is Very realistic and boring too , not for being a woman, but it's a extreme walking simulator of empty places, BUT the quality of story is great and I think Thereza is the best girl Henry can void his ""virgin achievement run or something kek* 

Personally I hate to my bones the crime system, I swear to god, I go into the houses, knock people out at night and sleeping, kill them, and somehow I get fined by the crime. (I properly fence stuff and etc), it's completely rigged. Yet you guess what ? I went to see my liege at rattay with more than 2k gold from simple murdering another fellows villagers and selling their stuff to the mill men. I think it's so punitive to the player because it's the quickest way to become rich without any real effort or skill involved.

My favorite part is the sidekick window and training my dog, it pleases me very much seeing my dog learning my ways of how to kill people by biting their ankles, best doggy in the world! 

I left out some immersion stuffs which are good like whetstone etc and lock picking, but there's some bad ones like needing to do lots of side tracks to be able to repair your gear, clean yourself for haggling and etc. 


Só despite the drawbacks I would recommend cause it's a great experience. 
Won't recommend trying to get 100%, won't recommend playing this with less than 10h per week, as sometimes you can't save when you want.

P.s: I wrote this on phone cause I can't sleep, sorry about any miss typo. 
P.s2: I wanted to write about the gameplay itself, the history of the game is fantastic so I don't think it's nice to spoil what this game has to offer.

Its commitment to realism—be it in combat mechanics, the lack of handholding, or the intricately crafted world of 15th-century Bohemia—creates an unparalleled gaming experience. 

I love this game for its depth and detail. The story pulls you in with its blend of personal revenge and broader political intrigue, told through well-developed characters. The combat system, while challenging, feels rewarding once mastered, as it replicates the complexity of medieval swordsmanship. The absence of magic and fantasy elements grounds the game, making every success feel earned and every failure a lesson. 

Exploring the lush countryside, stumbling upon hidden quests, and making choices that have real consequences adds layers of richness to the journey. The atmosphere, bolstered by stunning visuals and an authentic soundtrack, makes it a joy to simply exist in this world.

On par with the story - the highlight of the game.
++ I liked that separate activities: pickpocketing, lockpicking, alchemy, sharpening swords, and of course, the combat system, are all mini-games with their own rules where mastery comes with experience.
++ Perfect leveling system for such a game: the more you do something, the better you get at it.
++ Special praise for the ""Reading"" skill, where its level directly affects what the character sees in books.
++ The need for food, sleep, and cleanliness is harmoniously integrated into the game's pace.
++ The DLC about rebuilding the village: a new way to spend money (or rather invest) and see it materialize. Top-notch decision.

-- No ability to interrupt fast travel halfway.
-- Limitations on manual saves in the form of schnapps and small inventory capacity significantly slow down the game.
-- In my opinion, the idea of changing clothes depending on the circumstances is not well implemented: having a decent set of armor and high stealth almost eliminates the need to change clothes.
-- Small arsenal of weapons: at the beginning of the game, it seems like there's a lot, but by the second half, I found one sword, hammer, and bow that there was simply no point in changing.

Overall, the game is not difficult. All mechanics can be learned in a reasonable amount of time.
It's cool that the battles don't become too simplistic even towards the end of the game. Even with the best armor, there are real chances of dying from a crowd of peasants who simply stab you with sticks.

Important note: I played with infinite manual saves (requiring only one schnapps in the inventory) and unlimited inventory capacity. These simplifications allowed me to significantly speed up the game and make it less tedious.
There was no need for money after the first ~4 hours of the game, thanks to lockpicking and pickpocketing.

I didn't expect at all that a role-playing game about the Middle Ages with (as I thought) a focus on gameplay would pleasantly surprise me with its story.
Lively characters, a simple yet interesting story. Tragedy, comedy, love, and revenge are very well combined in the times of 14th century Bohemia.
Besides the main storyline, I want to praise:
++ side quests (not to be confused with activities) - which often contain quite interesting stories.
++ DLC: the stories of Theresa and Johanka perfectly represent the ""strong woman"" image, an image you believe in because it is grounded, realistic, and rational.
	I was especially touched by Johanka's story, which I couldn't complete to a certain ending and still wasn't disappointed, as both options make more than enough sense.
++ DLC: Hans Capon's adventures, on the contrary, offer a comedic story that allows you to distract from the rather grim events of the game.

---{ Game Time }---

I completed the main story and probably most of the side quests (quests, not activities). The game doesn't get boring. Only Theresa's DLC story gets a bit tiring towards the end.

Absolutely terrible hitboxes of bushes: sometimes it's impossible to pass through an almost completely transparent bush. This incredibly complicates movement through fields/forests.
I've seen NPCs fall from the sky a few times (not critical).
In quests with large ""team vs team"" battles, there were AI bugs - NPCs just stood still.

Survival here isn’t easy—everything feels slow and burdensome, reflecting the harsh reality of a naturalistic medieval setting. It’s a demanding and ruthless RPG, with one of the longest introductions in the genre. Combat is tough, stealing is tough. The game offers an unusual sense of real-world scale, which either pushes players away in the early hours or pulls them in completely.

And what light and shadow! The sense of awe it evokes reminds me of watching [i]Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon[/i]. A night in the woods, with thick branches blotting out the sky, feels truly dark—you peer into the impenetrable gloom, listening closely for the crackle of grass and the chirp of crickets, bracing yourself not to hear the howl of wolves drawing too near. The immersion is nothing short of breathtaking.

You soon adjust to the rhythm, and what once seemed like slow steps now feel deliberate, measured. Hunger doesn’t nag at you often; it comes at its proper hour, as it does in real life.

The combat system is a standout feature, using a directional melee combat style that mimics real medieval techniques. Players must master timing, precision, and stamina management to succeed in fights. There's a strong emphasis on weapon types (swords, maces, bows) and armor, with each affecting mobility and damage in different ways.

The game also implements a robust skill system that evolves through practice, similar to The Elder Scrolls series. Whether it’s lockpicking, swordplay, or alchemy, players improve through usage rather than arbitrary leveling. The survival mechanics add to the immersion: Henry needs to eat, sleep, and maintain his equipment regularly, which grounds the experience in a sense of historical realism.

Quests often have multiple solutions depending on player choices, with diplomacy, stealth, or brute force available. However, combat can be punishing, especially early on, and systems like saving and lockpicking can feel needlessly harsh for beginners. The save system requires special potions or sleeping, which limits experimentation and can lead to frustration.

Overall, Kingdom Come: Deliverance offers a richly detailed and challenging medieval experience, with mechanics that reward patience and tactical thinking, though some of its systems may prove divisive for casual players.

i enjoy this game very much, the combat system is very challenging yet its rewarding assuming you are still alive after it, and also the attention to detail is crazy as when you get injured it shows up in cutscenes and on your characters face visually, i rarely comment on music however the music in this game is very great and it fits the theme so well and it is sweet to listen to, so i easily recommend this gem of a game and its pretty underrated, and the main character named henry of skalitz is a lovable protagnist too, and i can easily vouch that the open world is perfect and great to explore..

get it on sale if possible, so the royal edition is cheap, but you get moneys worth either way.  and i really love the dynamic world, reputation system, and the graphics are very amazing to see, the difficulty in this game overall is pretty hard by default, not everyone will enjoy that. but other than that the cutscenes and story are a blast at the moment and i enjoy the writing and visuals too.

The attention to detail is impressive – from the landscapes to the characters’ outfits, everything is crafted to create a truly immersive atmosphere.

The gameplay is engaging, though the combat system can be tough at first. It requires patience and good timing, which might frustrate new players, but mastering it brings a real sense of achievement.

This is basically a historically accurate, ultra realistic elder scrolls game. You start off as a nobody and you have to level everything up. Not just the usual stuff like Strength and dexterity either. You have to learn to read and then level it up. You level up in drinking, horse back riding, fist fights. The sense of progression is tremendous because you level it up by doing those very things, it's not like some games where you get points and assign them.  The graphics are very pretty but in a realistic way. You know how some games look better than real life? Everything kingdom come goes for is true to life. You get tired, hungry, you have to bathe or people will smell you (making stealth harder and also npcs won't respect you or take you seriously). This is a bit much but it actually isn't overly tedious. Your character also can't carry a ton of stuff true to life though you can level this up. Still you will never be able to walk around with 22 swords like you can in most other rpgs. The open world is done extremely well, once again it's realistic so there are no volcanic mountain peaks and water worlds and lush jungles, this is all medieval Bohemian countryside.  There are zero loading screens in this game which is great, but it does suffer from some distant pop in graphics. This is one of the most alive worlds I have ever experienced in a video game. The 2 best games I have played this year are Cyberpunk and Baldurs Gate 3. While those games are amazing, the worlds never feel alive. The NPCs are very clearly NPCs that stand in the same location and don't do anything. In Kingdom Come every NPC has a life. They sleep, wake up, eat breakfast, go to work, church, the tavern, etc it's pretty spectacular. There are a lot of RPGs out there where money is practically useless, that is not the case here. The quests are extremely unique, never repetitive and there is no hand holding here. The voice acting is great, I find myself invested in most conversations and listen at the pace of the game, in comparison to baldurs gate where I typically read and skip through not waiting for the vocals. The atmosphere in this game is also 10/10 

Kingdom come does sacrifice accessibility and fun for the sake of realism. I originally played this on Xbox. I put about 20 hours in when I uninstalled and decided that whenever I get a gaming PC, I will restart Kingdom come. This is due  to the many mechanics in this game that will make you pull your hair out. First things first, this game has the WORST lockpicking in gaming history. Whoever designed the lockpicking deserves a kick to the dick because it's fucking awful. I have leveled it up, turned on simplified settings, tried mouse and keyboard, controller, literally everything. It's HORRIBLE. Its to the point where I modded lockpicking out of the game. In my 20+ years of playing RPGs I never once did that or felt the need to do that but it's a necessity here. The combat is also extremely clunky, it does get better the more you train but it is frustrating none the less. Archery doesn't have a crosshair which isn't the end of the world but I modded in a crosshair as well. The games saving mechanic is also extremely hardcore. You can only save when you sleep or when you drink an expensive drink called Savior Schnaps. I understand this is implemented to add consequence to your actions but the game has some bugs which makes the mechanic extremely frustrating. I modded this out as well I save whenever I want now. I am not typically a big modder but the saving and lockpicking mods were a necessity for me if I was to continue playing. Another issue is the NPC AI when it comes to guards. You can sneak around and steal stuff, nobody will see you and all of a sudden a guard will come shake you down like you were caught red handed. It makes zero sense. You can typically pay them off or run but it is still annoying. This doesn't occur all the time but it happens enough to be annoying. Riding horses is annoying on mouse and keyboard due to you having to keep clicking a button to speed your horse up. This is more comfortable just pressing B on a controller instead of mashing it with your pinky hitting shift. I actually play the entire game on controller. Apparently some think lockpicking is better on mouse and keyboard but as I said before I modded out the dreaded thing.

See what I mean? Love/hate. Some terrible mechanics and design decisions but also one of the most unique and amazing RPGs I have ever played. This game has pulled off things that no other game has been capable of doing. I would recommend this only on PC where you can remove the mechanics that you hate. Also, for a single player game, this community is so beyond toxic. I would recommend googling any questions instead of asking. This community will skold you for not liking every single design in the game. ""Skill issue noob! if you're going to mod out the saves or lockpicking why even play, go hop on fortnite, play in traffic and uninstall life"" Like okay bud it's a single player game let me play it how I want to, I bet you get all the girls beating Kingdom Come on it's hardest difficulty you loser lol.",1724733114,1724754027,True,7,1,0.5897762179374694,0,True,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

The fun lies within the sometimes humorously authentic portrayal of medieval bohemia. Even the things we see as weird or barbaric these days are portrayed. For example at the Monastery in the game they poop on the second floor toilets, and you can look through the toilet to see some trees below. Wouldn't want to be the gardener there. (You can even see some nasty stains along the walls below it outside.)

Focus only on the actual quests and levelling up skills and stats. Other than that the game isn't that great. Avoid wandering around looking for cool stuff in the open world. You won't find much ever. If you must look up where the treasure chests are...there aren't many to be found. However their rewards are actually quite good. Although the combat is jank and not all that fun if you have a powerful setup you can usually just pummel your way through things. Then you can get to the quests which are amusing and fun to do.

It's fun to kit yourself out with armor and medieval gear, then go out and help some peasants with their issues. I remember one quest where part of the quest was a lady putting up a stone cross as a penance for something bad she did in the past. It showed two dudes setting up the small cross as if it was the most impressive thing ever with triumphant music. It was just a basic stone cross. But to them it WAS impressive. This is the kind of amusingly authentic stuff in the game.

I particularly like the potion system as the potions aren't too hard to buy or make but have rather useful effects. Such as seeing better at night, allowing you to pick harder locks or get past difficult speech checks early...pretty much any application if you get the right potion it can help.

One thing I found really amusing was that when trying to get the ""don't kill anyone in an entire playthrough"" achievement, you can still kill people by running over them with a horse. In some cases, not killing a person makes a quest really really annoying to finish, such as the monastery quest. Instead, I choked the person out, carried their body to a road while they were unconscious, and ran over them with a horse a couple of times at a full gallop. This was a really funny concept to me, that ""my horse killed him"" rather than I did, so no one accused me of murder, and the achievement still unlocked at the end of the game. If I ever got to some point in the game where I got fed up and wanted someone out of the picture to speed things up...they got hauled to the old horse trampling road. 

Later on in the same ""don't kill anyone"" playthrough, soldiers witnessed the horror of I, a knight in shining armor jumping over the battlements of a castle and punching everyone up there to smithereens without a weapon. Soon everyone on the battlements was unconscious. Now that the knight's friends had arrived, they waited around 5 minutes standing there politely for the enemies to wake up from being unconscious only to immediately bonk them with a mace, killing them.

Gripes:
-The ""Open world"" is largely pointless. There is very little to discover by going out into the wilderness. A couple of treasure chests with useful gear, but 99% of the stuff in the wilderness is an ""interesting site"" with nothing of interest there. Just a long unused campfire usually. Or a literal pile of rocks. Or a broken wagon with a pair of pants in it. Or something stupid like that. Why even mark these on the map? There's literally nothing there. Oh - it's because open world games thrive on checklists and the facade that they have a lot to do in the game, whereas they actually just have a normal amount of content spread out massively in a bunch of empty nothingness. You know how much better this game would seem if it just focused on quests rather than pretending wandering empty forests was worthwhile?
-Enemies can fight like Maximus Decimus Meridius in a pitch black night with no torch whereas the player literally cannot see a single thing making it impossible to fight until you yourself take a torch out (which leaves you without a shield). For a game trying its damndest to be realistic this is super unrealistic that enemies can fight just as well with no light whatsoever. If you use a Nighthawk potion, things are easier. I realized that later.
-Game takes like 2 minutes to start up. Majorly slow in that regard. Even modding away the intro videos, it still takes a long time to start.
-Rattay, Uzhitz, and Talmberg run at like 30-50 fps on ultra with my 4070 ti. Wtf, how is this that unoptimized, this game has graphics straight out of like the early 2010s. Dunno how it is that demanding.
-Enemies constantly perform master strikes, making normal combat take forever. Somehow, standing right in front of the enemy in full armor and drawing your bow while taking hits to shoot an arrow point blank at their head is the fastest way of finishing fights. I feel this isn't well designed.
-The item list constantly changes sorting while you sell items for items with the same name, leading to you accidentally selling the wrong one. Very annoying.
-Although the soundtrack while exploring and playing is great, the tracks are a bit too short and there aren't enough of them. Some more variance and expansion to each track would be perfect.
-The game forces you to do Sir Hans Capon's Amorous Adventures DLC right at the end of the game to finish the game if you haven't yet. This DLC has very little to do with the story, so it seems like the devs just wanted to annoy players trying to finish the game on hardcore mode by adding *just one more thing* to do. I already did it, and so did everyone trying to finish the game repeatedly...stop with this nonsense.
-The game crashes somewhat often. I had it crash around 10 times in 200 hours of playing. I would heavily recommend playing with ""save whenever"" mod because having save restrictions on a game that can crash is a major aggravation.",1718366080,1718375807,True,69,8,0.8213430047035217,0,True,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

It's got a complicated combat system that feels great when your skills are high, you have good equipment, and you know how to use it. But that's not anywhere near where you are at the start of the game. Instead you're faced with a lot of text boxes and tutorials.

A couple of notes about this game that I don't see often in other reviews:

-While the game is known for its well-written main plot and side quests, I believe more commendation should be given to the ""stories"" you can discover throughout the greater world just by exploring your surroundings. For example, I accidentally fell halfway down a giant cliff between two major settlements, breaking both of my legs and nearly dying, only to find the dead body of a man who wasn't as lucky nearby. Another time, I followed a subtle trail that ended up with finding a very... disturbing scene in a barn. The world is massive, full of detail, and is absolutely worth exploring.

-The soundtrack (which took ~5000 hours to create) is also very impressive- the composers used only instruments that would be heard in this time period, avoided elements that would be too modern, and even composed their own Gregorian chants based on period music. AND it's catchy- I've had KCD music stuck in my head for over a week now.

-I see a lot of complaints about the combat system, but people are missing the point. The combat in this game is a little more realistic than in other games. You need to train yourself to use weapons effectively, or you won't be any good in combat. In the same vein, when fighting solo, you can likely defeat one opponent, but taking on three or more will probably not end well for you, even if you're well-trained and they're farmers or low-level bandits. It's just how it is.

-The game is buggy at times, but the game is so good that it doesn't even matter.

It's clear a ton of love went into this game, and I wish I could play it for the first time again. Can't wait for KCD2!

TL;DR: A slightly janky masterpiece. If you enjoy Elder Scrolls-like systems where you level skills by using them, and are interested by the idea of a medieval immersive sim where you can solve [b]most[/b] problems using different methods (i.e. brute strength, sneakiness, or charismatic speech), this game will probably delight you.[hr][/hr]
Somehow this game flew under the radar for me. I think I got it jumbled up with other medieval games that featured melee combat, or maybe the marketing just wasn't great. At any rate, I only became interested after watching Mortym's YouTube review. I got it and all the DLC for around $8, and wound up being so drawn in by it that I decided to 100% it, spending over 200 hours on it.
You play as Henry, a blacksmith's son who winds up being one of the few survivors of a military attack on his town. I don't want to spoil the plot, but the opening does a great job of putting you in the shoes of a hapless victim caught up in events far beyond the scope of his understanding. Over time this does get eroded a bit in order to let you feel like the protagonist in a story of escalating stakes, but it's effective all the same. While Henry starts off as a bit of an irresponsible kid, he matures over the course story, and grounding the experience with a likable POV character like this keeps the story more relatable than if you played a custom-made generic avatar. While I wouldn't argue that Henry's story is very realistic or typical to people of the time, it facilitates a game whose main goal is to let you explore and experience a somewhat realistic 1403 Bohemia.
Kingdom Come's gameplay is unique, but the closest experience I've had from a mechanical perspective is probably Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It's a first-person RPG that focuses heavily on real-time melee combat, and you level skills (and their associated attributes) by using them. Personally I love games that rely on this kind of leveling system, having sunk hundreds of hours into the Quest for Glory series as a kid. Thankfully, KCD's similarity to Oblivion ends there; leveling up is intuitive, you simply choose perks as your skills and stats increase, and enemies aren't scaled arbitrarily. Combat feels visceral, large melees can be realistically chaotic, and even if you max out your stats you can still easily get killed by a mob of armed peasants. This can be a bit frustrating, but keeps you from ever feeling like an unstoppable killing machine. Other mechanics also work to keep things grounded in reality. Henry starts off illiterate, and books are scrambled messes until you learn to read. Alchemy has you physically flipping through recipes, manually grinding and boiling herbs depending on the directions. Archery does not feature a reticle of any kind, and you must rely on practice to learn how to line up your shots. Not every system feels great, but the whole is a satisfying experience that feels fresh, if not perfectly polished.
This being a Kickstarter-funded game and the inaugural title from a new studio, I am surprised by how well-made it is. That being said, there is a fair amount of jank left here even six years after its initial release. The opening story doesn't adequately tutorialize the skills you'll need to survive the next mission, and the game doesn't doesn't let you know how you could have done things better when you inevitably fail, which makes for a frustrating first impression that I'm sure will put a fair number of players off. While there are a lot of great sidequests that let you solve problems in different ways, some are frustratingly single-solution and can break to one degree or another if you try to get too creative. There are plenty of bugs, and while I didn't find any that were completely game-breaking, they were certainly immersion-breaking and often very frustrating. I wish that the devs had left a small team working on this gem to get rid of these rough edges after release.
To briefly discuss the DLC, I would absolutely recommend picking it all up as a package, especially if you catch the game on sale. The base game is fairly bursting with great content, and the DLC is integrated seamlessly into the experience. While not everything is among the best the game has to offer (I personally didn't care for Theresa's POV quest), most of it is top-notch and features rewards that are useful without being game breaking.
As I did decide to complete them, I'd like to give a quick overview of the achievements. For the most part they're fine, but I would've preferred if they'd avoided achievements that are most realistically obtained through save-scumming, which is something that the very mechanics of the game discourage. This means that there are a few that require you to see both exclusive outcomes of decisions, especially in the DLC. Sure, you [b]could[/b] do it differently on a subsequent playthrough, but realistically it's not worth running entire optional quest lines again when you can just save before making a decision then load it back up to see both options. Also, there is a no-kill achievement that is Just Not Fun™. It makes things a little more challenging in some ways, but it winds up locking you out of entire quest lines, and even the main story becomes a real drag, forcing you to rely on NPC allies to do your dirty work while you try to distract enemies. If the game were designed to let you find non-lethal solutions to every quest this would be a great roleplaying encouragement, but it simply isn't and the experience suffers for it.
In the end, I absolutely vibed with Kingdom Come. The open world is beautiful and fun to explore, without pointless collection-fests or excessive fetch quests. There's a massive amount of bespoke optional content to tackle at your own pace, leveling skills feels organic and rewarding, and there are a few points where you can make choices that help shape Henry as a character. I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone due to its rough edges and somewhat niche design choices, but if it sounds even a little intriguing to you, I absolutely recommend giving it a try. I had a blast, and now I'm eagerly looking forward to another sequel I didn't care about at all at the beginning of the year.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance, developed by Warhorse Studios, is a medieval role-playing game that offers a unique and immersive experience. The game excels in historical accuracy, bringing the 15th-century Bohemian landscape to life with meticulous attention to detail. The realistic combat system, grounded storyline, and sprawling open-world contribute to the game's authenticity.

One of the game's notable strengths is its commitment to historical realism. From the architecture to the clothing, Kingdom Come: Deliverance captures the essence of medieval Europe, providing players with a captivating journey through a bygone era. The emphasis on realism extends to the gameplay, with a complex combat system that requires strategic thinking and skill development.

However, the game is not without its flaws. Some players have criticized the occasional bugs and technical issues that can detract from the overall experience. Additionally, the steep learning curve of the combat system may pose a challenge for newcomers to the genre.

Looking ahead, there's optimism for the potential of a sequel or future installments in the Kingdom Come series. With advancements in technology and the lessons learned from the first game, there's anticipation for even greater historical accuracy, improved gameplay mechanics, and a more polished overall experience. The foundation laid by Kingdom Come: Deliverance provides a solid base for the developers to build upon, and the potential for future installments to address and refine the current shortcomings is exciting.

In conclusion, Kingdom Come: Deliverance offers a unique and ambitious take on medieval role-playing, immersing players in a rich historical setting. While acknowledging its imperfections, the game sets the stage for a promising future, and fans can eagerly anticipate the evolution and refinement of the series in upcoming releases.",1707810891,1707810891,True,2,0,0.5454545617103576,0,False,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

However, once you get past that initial beginner hurdle you are in for a nice treat. A decently sized world with a overarching story and plenty other things to discover. Fully voice acted with some nice moments, especially when Hans Capon is involved. Quests can often be completed in many different ways, so you can play the way you prefer. It might not be the most polished RPG around, but it certainly has its charm. Looking forward to the sequel they announced a while ago.",1719658994,1719750732,True,2,0,0.5438596606254577,0,True,False,False,False,379430,20250114_132039,positive,100

I hope they'll fix this in the next game. Another thing that I disliked about this game is whenever you want to save the game (before doing something stupid/dangerous), you need a special potion to that. It's annoying me.

KCD is such a slowburn that I don't think it's for everyone. I almost gave up but I keep pushing myself believing it'll get good, and boy it did!

Played with some mods that allowed me to save at any time and some other small QoL stuff. I highly rec you do that, if something bothers you, there is prolly a fix for it.

The only flaws I can think of are to do with the physics of the game, which is minor, and fighting more than 2 or 3 people at once. Multiple opponents can lock you into a loop of constant clinching and it can be difficult to switch between targets in the middle of combat. Duels are challenging and a lot of fun though.
